795;795;2572_ptsd;‘Ruined’ thanksgiving I feel like the biggest POS. I was upset about something, and my s/o and I went to bed without talking. This morning was the same, and it caused an argument that led to me smashing my body mirror and quite literally acting like a child. I said some things about him - basically that I thought he was shit for cheating on me 3 months ago and being mad at me for being “sad all the time” and he responded with attacking my ptsd. He told me he was sick of this and that he’s been thinking about breaking up with me (we have been together 3 years and just bought a home..and I just started my ptsd therapy this year) and that once again I’ve ruined something with my problems. I feel so much pressure to get better, and now I’ve relapsed and cut. I’m almost 29 years old - I shouldn’t be cutting. And I feel like I have t hide this or it’s going to cause more problems. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, I feel like a fuck up.;0

If I knew how to “just move on”, I would hope I’d have done it by now. I know it’s in the past. People still have scars. Should they just move on and magically their scar is gone?

1184;1184;2180_ptsd;"""Oh hell no! It came back"" a mixture of fireworks and stress. (vent) This will be a brief account of the last few weeks and what it culminated in. Over the last couple of weeks, fireworks have been going off all over my part of town. Often, the people who are doing it set them off late at night 1 or 2 am.  My PTSD, after an incident with people throwing fireworks and a near riot, is triggered by fireworks, bright lights, loud sounds and people in a confined space. I have for the last two years kept this under wraps with a few problems along the way like zoning out or feeling rising panic in some situations, as well as some sensor issues.  


Either way, back to the fireworks in my town. With the fireworks at night, I have found that if I start my bed rutin again or get a specific fluffy blanket I can usually calm and soothe myself to sleep.  However a few days ago, just before New Year's eve as I was walking from the bus station after dropping my friends off, I noticed some kids running towards me. Thinking they were running to the bus I sidestepped out the way and kept going. Then it happened, I was close to coming round the corner and then ""bang"". A big flash of red light and sparks flew from around the corner. My first reaction was to stand still and as the last kid past me, I struggled not to grab onto him. My next reaction was to feel like crying. Which after a brief feeling of outer bodyness turned into a need for a smoke. I recently, and frustratingly, bought a packet of cigarets due to the bangs and the stress they were causing me. After that I then got back did the washing and tried to call the police non-emergency line to no avail, gave up and drank some whiskey. This obviously was a bad idea and just made me feel even worse. The follow on from that was to clean like a maniac.  


Roll on new year's eve and fireworks are everywhere, people on squares and roadsides. I was with my friend so it was a little better. At our party it seemed to miss a lot of the fireworks, We saw the new year in and crashed.  The day after new year's day, everything came crashing down. My reaction to stress was to just sleep and after I tried to get some work done I just broke down and smoked all my cigarettes. The stress and isolation this brought just hit me with a large hammer. Why was it like this? Who could I contact?. I tried contacting one of my friends and gave up. Then a feeling of needing to get out of this came about me and I got scared. I knew I had alcohol at home and that was a risk. So I ended up ringing my friend and ask them to be an accountablöity buddy for the night, as I was scared  I was going to go on a binge.   


Today, after writing this out I have eaten which was hard to do over the last few days and I have finished tidying. It feels like releasing some of this crap and meditating has helped.

1107;1107;2031_ptsd;"""The Body Keeps the Score"" is probably the most comprehensive and easiest to read book on PTSD I've posted about this book before on /r/ptsd , but it helped me so much, I think it bears reposting. The book came out in 2015, so its relatively new. It was written by a psychologist who attempted to treat PTSD in Vietnam Veterans in the early 1970s and has been trying to understand trauma of all forms for his entire career. It is written partly as a description of his career and the technological developments that helped doctors understand trauma, but it also goes into great detail describing the physical mechanisms of trauma and how to overcome them. And yes, you can overcome them.

I have PTSD from a near death experience that landed me in a 9 day medically induced coma. In trying to recover, I kept meeting people talking about 'energy' or memories living in our muscles and it just always felt confusing or vague and even more disempowering. This book REALLY demystified a lot of these concepts for me and helped me believe for the first time that not only were my problems understandable, but that there were practical things that I could do to move beyond them.";0

970;970;1538_ptsd;"(Potential trigger warning) My flashbacks are being triggered by public events at my college I was sexually assaulted and nearly killed a little over a year ago- it’s been 389 days, and I’ve survived it, and I am so proud of myself for it. (Was not on campus at the time)

Starting a few days ago, a spotlight was put on my college’s truly terrible handling of sexual assaults on campus, and people are very rightfully upset, because the school seriously and repeatedly fucked up, to the point where they could face legal repercussions. The thing is, the students here are very vocal about and frequently fairly united on their opinions on issues like this. So now I’ve been getting about five emails every day about ‘addressing campus sexual assault’ or whatever (my tone is dismissive because administration is just trying to minimize the problem without actually trying to solve it) and starting today, there’s a massive sit in in our union building, there are local news crews here to cover it, and there must be thousands of fliers everywhere on campus. It has been months since I was as triggered as I was today. I have had multiple panic attacks, flashbacks, and auditory hallucinations. I feel like I can’t even breathe when I’m not locked away in my room, but even there, I’m starting to feel like a caged animal. I don’t think the organizers of the sit in (the sit in is the reason for all the other things listed) realize how damaging this is to the very population they’re trying to champion, and I don’t know how to fix it enough that I feel okay in my own skin on campus again.";1
915;915;2685_ptsd;"(Trigger warning) the memory barrier I built of my childhood started collapsing last week after watching a movie. This is a bit of a rant and probably horribly structured 

I watched the movie honey boy and the similarities broke down the memory wall I built. My mental health had hit critical about two years ago, I was diagnosed with complex ptsd with suicidal ideation, which I had known for awhile it was most likely that. I started going to therapy, I quit drinking and doing drugs, started medication again, things have been getting better slowly. Now the wall is down, memories and emotions started flooding in, flashbacks started again, suicidal ideation started more frequently ( I will never go through with it) and for the life of me I can't seem to understand how bad my situation was growing up, I know it was wrong and not normal but something is blocking me from viewing it rationally. It was just my life, I have no other perspective or anything I can compare it to.  I'm more writing this out to just to get it out so... Here we go

My first memory of my father was when I was 2 to 4, my mom was leaving for work, he was hungover I'm assuming and I was crying staring out the window because she was leaving me, I didn't stop after she left, I remember my dad had his hand on his face not looking well, barley attempting to calm me down when he grabbed my pj shirt and slapped me across the face, the memory ends there. Typically he would use a belt or a metal shoe horn, he didn't get more physical until I was older but that is maybe my first memory of my childhood that comes to mind. Everything is fuzzy but that one is clear as day. I would run away from him when I would get in trouble and he would chase me around the house snapping his leather belt over and over until he caught me and would then beat me bare ass with it, I can't remember the pain or even being hit with the belt, I just remember the before it happened. I do remember I would become hysterical often but I can't clear up andly specific memories, I just feel the emotion and I know it happened often. 

The next portion of memories start when I thought my parents, mainly my dad, my mom was never abusive, would turn into wear wolves when I would turn my back, everytime I turned around I thought they were sneaking up on me claws over their heads about to eat me, I would often follow them around and try to catch them, I had a fear of being alone because I always thought they were going to get me if I wasn't paying attention. this continued until around 10 or 11, I don't know why that thought process stopped but it just did.

I know my dad was also verbally abusive but I can't really remember specifics I just know it happened often. Things like don't be a pussy or don't be such a girl with the occasional smack upside the head and such. I was a very sensitive child and wished i had been a girl, maybe because my sister didn't get it as bad as I did, I'm not 100% sure why those thoughts started so early but they were vivid.

Around 9 the abuse started changing and progressing into more abrubt violence, less spankings more being thrown against walls and choked although I can remember only two times this happened I wouldn't be suprised if it was more often, smacks across the head, the verbal abuse escalated into more of a bully harassing way, he would do things to just tease or torment me, specific memories are hard to clear up enough to get a good picture, I remember one time he showed me a pressure point on my foot and refused to let go, I was crying it hurt so bad and ended up hitting him in the face and then he lost his temper idk stuff like that. The inappropriate behavior of exposing me to adult things like porn and inappropriate movies, letting me drink a beer or some wine, no sexual abuse I can remember so that's a relief. I started being more aware of his behavior and knowing he was wrong most of the time , I didn't like the way he would treat people in public, he was very racist, he would often put my mom down, they divorced when I was 7. I also started talking back more and challenging him and he seemed to for the most part loose interest in me, I would often leave the house and spend most of the day with friends in the neighborhood. I had very little parental oversight at this point after the divorce and would mainly fend for myself most of the time. By 8 or 9 during summers I was mostly left to do what I wanted, my sister was there but she was a teen and barley kept tabs on me.

My suicidal ideation started around 11 In middle school where I was bullied a lot, the change in the social behavior didn't really click for me until around 8th grade when I taught myself how to be accepted. I started drinking often on weekends in 8th grade, smoking cigarettes by 9th I discovered weed and that was my miracle cure, I couldn't stand ever not being high or drunk and almost all of high-school was just one big party that lasted 10 years too long. I was lucky I never enjoyed the harder stuff besides my love of cocain but it never became too much of an issue. At 15 the end of my relationship with my father happened, he picked me up from school when I was sick and we got in a fight where he punched me several times in the face and I jumped from his moving car, he never got in trouble for it, my mom and sister begged me not to press charges and that was pretty much the end of my relationship with them as well, since the defended him, my sister took his side and my mom who is a push over just wanted the drama to go away and kept trying to get me to forgive him, I lost all respect for either of them and realized I was on my own. That pretty much set up my teen years of balls to the wall not thinking I would live past 18 and to be honest I'm pretty suprised I did, multiple arrests and forced rehab probably ended up saving me. 

I don't know how to feel about all of this, there isn't an emotion to describe any of it, it just makes me feel sick to my stomach. I know it's pretty screwed up but it's hard to see it, it was just my life, that's just what it was.";0

Hello everyone, I'm new to this subreddit so I don't know what terms are used here or about tws or anything. Long story short, my abuser choked me during consensual-ish sex once but since he abused me so many times I can never separate the choking sensation from the trauma and everytime my partner touches my neck or accidentally puts pressure on it I panic. Lately I've been having neck muscles issues so I feel a lot of tension around my neck area and it's an instant trigger, specially when my partner makes me look at her or really any forced movement (like turning my head or sth, nothing more than that). She knows about everything but she doesn't know about the choking and I'm too embarassed to tell her because there's nothing either of us can do that I know of? I also feel like I'm exaggerating bc someone literally tried to actually choke her once and I don't want to trigger her and I feel like my trauma is Nothing compared to that. Anyways, advice?? how do i stop feeling like anything near my neck is him? I'm not in therapy but I'm on meds.;1
1131;1131;2434_ptsd;"(TW) A bad sexual experience when I was 18 still affects me, I’m not sure if I was traumatized Okay, I’m going to preface this by saying that I did have a moderately traumatic childhood, I want to contextualize things in hopes to give better insight. 
I grew up in a turbulent and dysfunctional environment, I was also tormented by my peers growing up and endured profound alienation and loneliness. My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I’ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they’d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn’t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn’t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. 

When I was 18 (I’m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.

On my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me. We met up and drove around, hung out at his place and divulged in deep conversations for hours on end. 

After a couple of times he became very flirtatious and made a pass at me. 
I was pretty sexually inexperienced and he knew that, in hindsight I feel as though  he fetishized my innocence (he casually) brought it up countless times. When we first started hooking  up , it was pretty vanilla and ..normal I guess.


Overtime he began to become really aggressive and rough , he was kind of coercive and disregarded some of my boundaries. He would choke me so hard to where I would run out of air and the next day my neck would be riddled with bruises (I was okay with choking but not that extreme). I have a visceral memory of how dark and sinister his eyes looked while he would do this. 

On one occasion he did something  I did NOT consent too and it really upset me, I consented you’re sex but not what he did in the midst of it(I don’t feel comfortable being less vague ) it wasn’t I’ve isolated thing, but during that instance I remember spacing out until it was over with..was paralyzed and couldn’t think. He took me home and gave the impression he was oblivious and things were fine ,  I didn’t tell him what I was feeling. I felt stupid because I am partially responsible for putting myself in a compromising position and allowing myself to be taken  advantage of, I also had such little value in myself that I didn’t want him to stop seeing me. After a while he ghosted me, and I was devastated. I was angry and felt used and beat myself up over it for a while. 

He also dated a string of girls around my age, I didn’t find that off until it was over though. 

I didn’t tell anyone about this, I didn’t want my parents to find out or to be judged but I feel like this was a tipping point into my descent of substance abuse and depression. 
There were so many other things that contributed 
To my depression manifesting and festering over time and this wasn’t the worst thing that happened to me per-say but it was the straw that broke the camels back. 

I haven’t had sex in 2 years  I don’t date and I wish that I could go back In time and stop everything from happening. I wish I could scrub it from my mind entirely but I can’t and I still have dreams about the whole ordeal. 


Any advice on how to open up about this to a therapist, I’ve always felt too embarrassed to. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to have or want s relationship and It sucks.";1
977;977;2197_ptsd;"[23F] What makes you feel better after a flashback? Hi everyone,

I am 23 and the main trauma that gives me flashbacks is my abusive relationship. I have got myself into a real state with an emotional flashback to the day I tried to commit suicide. I just kept remembering how sad I was and how horrible it was and I couldn't stop crying. It's 2.52am and I want to go get some fresh air and make some tea but I'm scared I'll wake my parents. they know about my ptsd but it is still difficult to understand.

It is heartbreaking to see, and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why he’s not living at his parents house

1087;1087;2536_ptsd;"[CW childhood abuse] My rabbit is sick and I'm losing it. I'm mostly posting this just to get it off my chest, but any advice you can give me would be super appreciated.

I'm freaking out right now. My rabbit is sick, and we don't know what's wrong. She finally stabilised today, and the vet was frankly shocked that she survived. He's running some tests now to determine what caused this episode (GI stasis and hypothermia, in case you were wondering). Thing is, this is a huge trigger for me and I have no idea why. 

The things that happened to me when I was a child were physical in nature for the most part, the only ""traumatic"" event I can think of that involved a pet was when my mother accidentally reversed over our (very old and deaf) cat while I was in the car. It was upsetting certainly, but compared to the other things that happened it seems ""minor"".

We lost another rabbit about 6 months ago to a tumor on her heart, and that broke me. I had to take time off work (I still haven't gone back) and that episode finally pushed me to seek therapy. At the time, I saw it more as the straw that broke the camel's back, but now I'm wondering if maybe there's something more.

I fucking hate this all consuming anxiety. I can barely function. I can't eat, I barely sleep, I've had constant nightmares, and I've just burned through my anti-anxiety meds. I'm even doing the hyper-vigilance thing with my other pets now, analysing their every move for any signs of illness. I know intellectually that they're okay, but I can't stop freaking the fuck out about it. 

Worse still, my partner is dealing with their own anxiety so I can't lay this all on them either without making them feel awful.

Rereading this it looks like I've got some serious trigger bullshit going on here, but I have no idea what it could be.

I'm just ranting at this point, but it feels a little better to have it written down. If you're reading, then thank you for your time.";1
134;134;1381_ptsd;"[NFSW] [Vent] [Trigger Warning] Feel like I won't recover It's difficult to believe if you look at me normally, or the way I talk about my family. I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.

I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.

I just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? 

A few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.

I feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. 

I think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future. I just want to be ok. :( ";1
1031;1031;2211_ptsd;"[NSFW][TW] about some questions i had recently i was diagnosed a few months ago by accident (because i was originally seeing the psychiatrist for a dyslexia assessment) so i didn't have a chance to ask anyone about this. i wanted to be mindful of others when posting so i'll say right now *there is a* ***content warning/trigger warning*** *for mentions of sexual assault and rape.*

recently i've started watching Harlots on hulu, and in it there are several scenes where a character is either sexually assaulted or raped. i have no memory of either of these things happening to me, but for some reason when i saw them it immediately set off a panic attack and had me crying inconsolably. this has only happened a handful of other times before when a friend showed me a graphic novelization of a story shared by several comfort women from WWII, and when i wasn't fast enough to fast forward through the opening scene of an L&amp;O: SVU episode. i've never had this reaction when someone on either of these shows mentions an act of assault or describes it, it was only the graphic depiction of it. the only other thing i can really latch onto is that, when i read about someone being assaulted on the news or through social media topics, i get a very weird feeling down there. it's not pain, just a reflex, but it absolutely isn't enjoyable. it starts off this very heavy feeling in my stomach that sticks with me for hours, and i feel very detached from everything afterward.

is it possible that something has happened to me and i've just blocked it out so heavily that i can't even go back to a moment in time that would hint to me why i'd be reacting this way? i was predated on in the past, through chatrooms in an online game i used to play, but i never met anyone i talked to and therefore had no physical contact with them. i'm afraid to ask my family, because someone will immediately say i've made it up and that nothing bad has ever happened to me. i just want some kind of answer, and if anyone could help me i'd really appreciate it. thank you.";0

1119;1119;2481_ptsd;*nsfw?* Attempted suicide for the 20 something time last week. Therapist said there’s a high chance I will end up dead by my own hand. I (26f) don’t want to go into a lot of detail because I’m still processing everything. I had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. Last Wednesday I drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. They took me to the nearest hospital where I actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me. I’ve literally lost count of how many attempts I’ve made, but I know it’s in the 20 range. Most of them occurred in a 3 month period about 5 years ago, but my first attempt was at 13. My therapist (who I switched to about 6 months ago as my last therapist was useless) told me very bluntly that if I don’t get my shit together that I will die by my own hand before I die of old age. She said people like me often don’t make it. She also said my parents expect that I will die from suicide. It shook me to my core. It was my first attempt in over 4 years and it was different than the others. This attempt terrified me. I don’t remember much of it. It’s like a few days later I woke up from horrible nightmare thinking what the fuck have I done. I don’t want to die. I don’t want my ex to have this much control over me years after I broke up with him. Has anyone told you anything similar? How did you cope? Maybe if I just hide in bed the rest of my life I’ll live to be 80. She said I can do it, but I need to realize the harsh truth of the matter that I have already beat the odds too many times. I feel unfixable. Will I be broken forever? Will I live until I’m 80? I really hope so, but now I’m not so sure. Attempting suicide became a coping mechanism for me years ago but I thought after a year and a half of therapy I could go the rest of my life without an attempt.

1096;1096;2155_ptsd;"*tw: sexual assault* my story, and a few questions **Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault**

okay so this is gonna sound weird so i'll start from the beginning

So, it started two years ago when I met a girl we'll call Jamie. So Jamie and I had a lot in common, and immediately became friends. I was new in town and she was my first friend.

The trouble started a year later, (I was 12 at this point, yup I know I'm young) when she started making some horrible comments. For example I told her I was bullied at my last school and she smirked and said ""Oh, so you're an easy target"" It felt weird, I wasn't sure how to react.

Later, when school started again, she kept making comments like those or about my body. I definitely was an early bloomer and she was as well, but she really bugged me about some things about myself.

Then, she molested me. Several times.

At first it was subtle touches, and she told me she was just physical with friends. I thought it was weird because she wasn't that way with other people.

Then it got worse, like a lot worse. Not rape, but intense making out etc.

So that happened at the end of the school year and I didn't see her over the summer.

It was the worse summer of my life, and when school started I was extremely suicidal. At this point, I told a close friend. They helped me a lot.

Jamie took it way too far a few days ago. I'm shaken over it. I just want to get her out of my life.

Jamie is still abusing me.

But here's my problem. I want to report Jamie, I really do. But I feel like I can't for two main reasons

1. She's popular at my small school, everyone knows her. It's a private school, so everyone knows each other anyways but she seems like such a nice person on the outside.
2. I don't want to go to a hospital/inpaitient. I'm terrified of that.

Please, if someone knows what I can do say something. I'm sick of feeling alone.";1
69;69;84_ptsd;"*TW* I still remember like it was yesterday *TW* January 14th marked 7 years since I was r*ped. It wasnt what everyone thinks of when they hear the word. It wasnt ""forced"". I was manipulated for a year and a half, and on january 14th, 7 years ago, I was convinced to take anxiety pills, that he was the only one who could love me and wanted to touch me, and so I let him. I thought that sex was just a requirement of love. I didnt realize I had been manipulated for months. Thankfully my parents came home early that day and caught him, otherwise I might not have ever realized what he did was wrong. I was 14, he was 19. He tricked me in so many ways. Made me feel special, convinced me I was his one and only. He used the fact that I had recently developed mental issues and wormed his way into my fragile state. He got me pregnant. He never knew, because I miscarried before the court date 3 months later. It was my first time having sex, my first time being pregnant, and my first miscarriage. At 14. I am now 21. I still have nightmares. I still can barely have sex without flashbacks. I still cringe every time I see his name. I still wince every time I see or hear someone that reminds me. And I still panic every year on that day. 
The worst part? Its not even the flashbacks anymore. Its the baby fever I get that reminds me of the baby I lost. Its the tear I wipe away every time I see my nephew or niece, the moments of sadness when I pass the baby isles in walmart. Its knowing that I had a precious thing growing inside me from such a horrible event, a beautiful star amidst all the blackness, and the stress he caused took that away too. 
But after all this, I have one thing I would like to say to you A.S.W.: 
You didn't get the best of me. 
You may have broken me then, but I am being fixed now and you will never see the woman I am becoming.
You will never know the child you lost, but you will have a stain on your soul that even you can't figure out. 
One day I will be whole again. 
One day I will go days, weeks, months, and even years without thinking of you, and I can't wait to never think of you again.
One day you will die and your soul will be weighed, and you may not have remembered me, but your gods will, and you will get what you deserve. 
So yes, some days hope gets me through, and some days its the knowledge of justice, but I am getting through and I AM DOING IT WITHOUT YOU.";1
1069;1069;1840_ptsd;"//rant. i'm eighteen. i've been diagnosed with severe depression, ptsd, and acute anxiety since i was sixteen. alot of things have happened to me; from being neglected throughout my childhood, being physically and mentally abused by my mother. when i was thirteen i lived in a home during the big freeze in 2013. i live near buffalo new york, so believe me when i say it was cold, and there was too much snow to go to school. my house was falling apart. it was in the negative 30's and we had no insulation. all we had was a woodstove, and my father who was the only one who knew how to work the woodstove well enough to refused to get up to start it. we froze for hours before our aunt came and picked us up and took her to her house. 

flash forwards to the next year. summer. starting highschool. we moved in with my aunt. my cousin, who's about a year younger or two younger than me tended to get his siblings to help him pin me down and he'd waterboard me everyday for weeks. i tried telling my parents about it, and all they told me was that i was a highschooler and i needed to get over it. i was a straight A student but i only got to the end of freshman year before breaking down. at the end of my sophmore year i dropped out. planned to kill myself, but it didn't work. tried to go back to school, but that didn't work either as i was unmedicated. 

and now, i've been having nightmares. i don't know if they're repressed memories or not, but it's only of someone kissing my neck and me feeling disgusted and i've been falling apart. i feel so disgusting aand i don't know what to do anymore but just curl up and mourn over everything that i've gone through because they. ruined everything. i isolated myself for years from my family, i lost my best friend, my future. i was gonna get a scholorship but fuck that i'm just an asshole who sits around all day moping about shit thats happened in the past and i hate it i hate myself";1
4;4;104_ptsd;"&amp;#x200B;

the biggest problem i have is that i fear so much to go out in public.  i fear that everyone knows and thinks i'm disgusting and ontop of all that i feel disgusting.  my body was basically used and thrown away by C and even after C did this to me and told the school i was a r\*pist, one of our mututal friends who still talked to me told me C said that i ""had a nice d\*ck"" like what the fuck.  i feel so much shame and  violated, uneasy, disgusting, etc.  and i've felt like this for almost the majority of my life now because i had no way to cope with it or deal with it healthily until seeing a therapist recently.  i feel so damaged and i blame myself honestly for even getting into that situation to begin with.  i wish i could've gotten away but it seems like C will always loom over me and have power over me because C is a ""victim. . .

if anyone has any helpful advice of how i can move past this please help.  it's becoming unbearable to deal with.  thank you and sorry for the long, drawn out story.";0
822;822;2184_ptsd;"15 years ago today, and it feels like it could genuinely happen again at any moment TW home invasion. TW gun violence.

&amp;#x200B;

Today it is 15 years since the event my family called The Incident. When I was 16, we went through a home-invasion in the middle of the night, in which I and my parents were shot. My parents and brother were also beaten. Though we all survived (by mere heartbeats, and with some permanent injuries), the level of violence and disregard for human life we experienced is grotesque.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in South Africa. Today, I board with my parents because they need the financial support, and because I frankly don't think it is safe to leave them alone in the old house. Yes, we still live in the same place. This time of the year is always the worst. July (midwinter here) gets freezing cold, just like that night I spent lying on the concrete in a pool of my own frigid blood, convinced that I was dying. We cannot go to bed until at least after midnight. We listen for the slightest sounds and stare out of the windows at shadows in the blackness.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are well into their 70s, and my father was disabled by the attack. They are struggling to live on a puny pension  (equivalent to about $70 a month) and my rent. I cannot get them to a safer place. I feel trapped here, playing the one younger stronger man in the household whose presence can hopefully deter an attack.

&amp;#x200B;

The usual July crime-wave is sweeping our area again. Yesterday a next-door-neighbour's house was broken into and ransacked. There is a small minority of people in this country who want White people dead. A month ago a young couple was shot to death in cold blood in a racist attack a couple of blocks away from me when their car ran out of fuel. They were executed, and the car was torched. These incidents constantly remind us of the hatred we tasted on that night. My nightmares of being shot are increasing in frequency, and last night I dreamt a man was slicing into my chest from all angles with a knife, in exactly the place where I was operated on after being shot. It seems at any moment it could all happen again.";1
159;159;844_ptsd;"2 year anniversary of my assault is about a month away. I’m struggling. I’ve been holding it all inside pretty much since it happened. Only a handful of people know, I’ve never really talked to any of my therapists about it. (I also have BPD so I’m already medicated and in therapy)

I recently started seeing a counsellor specifically trained in my type of assault and am  going to actually start working through it. Today was my second appointment.

Half way through my appointment, we weren’t even talking about my trauma, I just started having flash backs. I couldn’t pull myself out of them. I could hear her talking to me but I could also just hear everything happening in the flash back over and over again.

Then of course I snapped back and had to explain what happened and talk about it and bawled my eyes out.

Ever since I just can’t get it out of my head. The months ahead are going to be tough, I can feel it.

I only have one other friend who has PTSD who understands, just needed another place to put it out there.

Thanks for listening. Stay strong everyone.";0
637;637;1160_ptsd;"2003 It happened in the fall of 2003. I was getting off the bus and a boy that lived in my neighborhood was walking to his house. I ran up and tackled him, as we have done many other days before. We would always wrestle, have snowball fights, goof off. Today was different. 

When he got up he grab my arms and I grabbed his back ready to wrestle. Thats when I felt something hit my in the ear hard and my leg buckled. I was then throw to the sidewalk and he laid on top of me and kept hitting me with his right fist into my left cheek. I remember trying to get up and saying ""Let me get up"" but kept getting punched in the side of my face. Then the back of my head was slammed into the concrete. I was then let up. I didn't know what to do. It was me, him and one ""friend"" just watching. He looked again, smiled, and came towards me. Again, I was thrown to the ground, hit in the side of the face multiple times, and had the back of my head slammed into the concrete. 

I walked home to find a knife, any weapon, but couldn't find anything but a brick in my front yard. I walked back to scare him to try and get him to back down. I didn't ever want to hurt anyone. I dropped the brick and again I was thrown to the ground, punched repeatedly and had my head slammed. It must have been 3,4,5 times. 

I walked home with that ""friend"" and immediately cried and broke down. This day has replayed in my head freqently ever since it happened. I turned to drugs at 14. Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything. Plotted suicide. 

Its been 15 years and it has been replaying in my head ever since. I have difficultly making friends. I stay home most weekends. I feel i will never amount to anything. On the outside I look successful. I work at a great company, I go to night class to further my career, I was a successful amateur boxer, I have a great family and girlfriend. But I cannot shake this event. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living. 

I started going to therapy consistently in 2016. I have done talk therapy, cbt, EMDR, energy healing,... I am lost. I hope I can get through this but there are times I feel I will never be confident. I still binge drink and still go through depressive spells. I wonder how my life would be if this didn't happen. It has been 15 years. 

If you have taken the time to read this I really appreciate it. I know time is very valuable and this is a rambled wall of text.  ";1
650;650;610_ptsd;"24 years later; PTSD diagnosis. Hi. I’ve been reading this sub for a while, suspecting I had ptsd. For years I’ve abused various substances, suffered with anxiety, depression and insomnia. Having recently engaged with an addiction counsellor brought up some of my past. When I was 14 my friend was beaten so badly he died of complications relating to brain trauma a few days later. I was sat next to him. I got dragged through a murder trial. Never once did I cry about it. Turning to drugs, drink, petty theft and violence almost immediately after. My mother I suspect is a covert narcissist and my father an emotional black hole. The whole thing got brushed aside while I started to burn my life. 

My whole life I thought I had absolutely no feelings around this. I genuinely felt nothing. Zero. Until I stumbled across it in counselling. Only now am I coming to realise I do have very strong feelings around this. For 20 odd years I’ve been suppressing this with various substances, never realising the reason for my pain. Only now realising why I feel scared when the phone rings (one of my friends rang me to tell me my friend had died).  

My doctor diagnosed me with ptsd today. I thought I’d feel relieved but I just feel incredibly sad that I’ve been carrying this around with me for so long, buried so deep, manifesting in depression, insomnia and substance abuse amongst other things. Thank you for reading. And thank you all for giving me the strength to write this.";1
1066;1066;1508_ptsd;"30 year old male improving his life but has serious issues with relationships and social interaction &amp;#x200B;

30   year old male who could be described as good looking. Suffering from   PTSD the last nine years (outset was six months after turning 21). Doing   EMDR therapy which is helping but therapist had to take two week off  so  some issues, so I am seeing myself start to fade into my old ways  and  I'm not happy about it. This treatment seems to be one of the most   effective treatments so far so I am hoping it helps me.

I   have had really bad social issues the last nine years since the PTSD.   It got progressively worse around 24 years of ago. I used to maintain   somewhat of a network of friends. However, I deactivated all social   media platforms which may be actually a good idea and have not made much   of an effort to make friends. Lot of my former friends are screw ups   and other ones are narcissist kinds of all people.

In   order to better myself and try to meet people, I Joined the gyms,   worked out, went to only one meetup (thinking about going to others) and   just job hoped leaving jobs after no time at all due to this PTSD   bullshit. Resume is completely bullshitted by a few people I know who   own other businesses.

I do make   money though and I do so by my online business in eCommerce  which has   been growing but my B.A degree hasn't done much if anything for me.   Didn't meet many women the last three years of school unless they were   online I was so psychologically fucked up.

So   as far as relationships since this is a relationship sub-reddit, I  have  dated all the wrong kinds of women. I am guessing that is because  of my  own problems and maybe I can contribute some of it to bad luck, I  am  not sure. I have dated mostly narcissistic women who don't give a  flying  fuck about anyone but themselves.

I   have met a lot of them online and have not met many women offline in   probably five years or so. My two close friends I still keep in touch   with can't introduce me to any women. I had a girl I went to high school   with who apparently suffering from Boarderline personality disorder   call the police on me and lie saying I was suicidal. Well, she   technically had someone else (a third party as the police said) call the   police and tell them I told the individual I was suicidal. It was big   pile of shit and all lies. She was projecting her feelings of suicidal   on to me after I told her I will never speak to her anyway because she   has no empathy at all.

So all   these years, I've spent time having sex and or going to strip clubs and   engaging in sex with escorts. I have completely fucked up the way I  look  at women. I went from a kid who had good morals to a complete con  man  and liar. My grandfather was in organized crime and I have been  having  the worst feeling that I could end up like him due to the way I  am  turning out. I have no criminal record but have gotten into issues  with  the police and other law enforcement tasks force. I always managed  to  escape getting any record.

I   almost feel like the way I look at most women is that they only give a   fuck about money and that is it. I never wanted to believe this shit  but  I am from Connecticut and people without money here, don't make  much of  any good life for themselves. For the past decade, I planned on  moving  down South as much of my family is living down there. I don't  fucking  know. For the most part, I have lots of issues with  relationships and I  think by reading my post, you can tell them.

Obviously,   goes back to my childhood so I am hoping this EMDR therapy helps (have   an appointment this Wednesday). If anyone has any positive or   constructive criticism, please let me know. Please don't respond with   completely negative bullshit. I really don't need to hear it from you   trolls. If you want to say something that you would think could help,   then do so. I don't want to sound like a wimp but enough is enough. I am   really tired of all this bullshit.";0
1199;1199;1777_ptsd;"4 Years - Pain Indescribable - TW: Preg loss, clinical death survival I’ve been living with PTSD, MDD for 4 years now. This was added to the OCD and generalized anxiety I’ve had since childhood. I feel like I’m losing this war and I just don’t want to keep fighting. I am to a place where I daily unravel and sob, wail, scream uncontrollably for hours until I pass out or someone gets me medical attention. I can’t stop reliving my trauma. My psychiatrist identified 5 inciting events and it’s more than I can bear. 

I want to forget the septic shock and feeling the most unbearable pain while knowing I was in organ failure. I want to forget getting pregnant and learning I was due on my dads birthday. I lost him years ago and he was everything, I was elated. Until the worst happened and I lost the pregnancy. I want to forget them strapping my knees with belts to the stirrups. I want to forget the two doses of fentanyl/versed not working and being lucid during the manual dilation and hearing the sounds of losing my baby. I want to forget when later that year I died and it took 40 minutes of CPR, drugs, intubation and ventilation to bring me back. I came back twice before the third time saved me. I wish I didn’t remember waking up on a ventilator with a tube in my lungs. I wish I could forget the faces of my nurses and doctors, their panic and tears in the eyes of the nurse by my side - Cara - I’ll never forget her name. I lost consciousness while Cara cried over me and told me to hang on. 

How do I forget these things when I close my eyes?? How the hell do I move on? I have a psychiatrist and counselor who I see regularly. I’ve had inpatient treatment. I don’t want to die and I can’t live like this forever. ";1

I’m also a flight paramedic on a helicopter and a few years ago, 4 months after I got back from the Middle East on a contract assignment I lost my partner, my pilot, and nearly a good friend when my helicopter crashed (I was not on board). Ever since the crash, shit got crazy for me and I was diagnosed with CPTSD. The stress of the crash was a catalyst and all my trauma from childhood, my job, and the Middle East  came screaming to the surface with nightmares, flashbacks, disassociation, and anything would set me off into violent rages. I mean 0-60 in a flash. I’ve been working with my therapist and working towards EMDR but I guess I need some sort of imaginary box to lock up and store the bad shit. My therapist said that I need to imagine a safe place to store this stuff where I can recall it and safely place it back in the “box” when I’m done with working on it in EMDR. my problem is that this imaginary box is hard for because visualizing this and working it the way she wants me to work with it doesn’t seem to work.

702;702;1509_ptsd;"A couple weeks ago I randomly remembered about 1.5-2 years I guess I forgot. I repressed most of my childhood and I like it that way, but I didn't realize I was missing adult years. Anyone else lose large amounts of time as an adult? I'm not sure how to explain this. I'll start by saying I moved out right at 18, but ages 19-21 have always been hard to remember. I'm 37. Before now, I could tell an occasional story about those years but I couldn't ever get a timeline to make sense for me and never wanted to delve too deep into it. Mostly I think my memory loss is a protective measure and I appreciate and enjoy it. 

All of a sudden, out if the blue, it hit me like a ton of bricks and the full extent of my repression was glaringly apparent. It was to the point where up until recently, the information about where I thought lived during part of that time would have even been wrong. Now I'm being flooded with memories of a time I now know I didn't want to remember. I don't want them. 

It also makes me question my reality. For example: A couple years ago something happened at a bar where I was sexually assaulted. I always thought I was roofied because that time is just gone. I don't know what happened, just that I was missing for a while after going outside, and I got out of someone's grip pulling my arm really hard in the alley behind the bar. I was covered in bruises and could barely walk for days afterwards. Talking it over with some friends, I'm not sure I'm missing enough time to have been drugged, and no idea what happened in that alley. 

Basically, I feel insane because of my memory loss. Anyone know how to cope with this?";1

&amp;#x200B;

some backstory:

C is a very manipulative and terrible person. C would constantly pit our friend group against each other and then was the ""ring leader"" sort of deal. C honestly never cared about any of us and just wanted our fully devoted attention.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm 21 now living in a different country and this happened to me when i was around 13/14 yrs old. i was at a party with a friend and we and a couple others had a sleep over together afterwards. the next morning i awoke to my friend (let's call her C) lightly caressing my private part down below. i thought i just had morning wood and ignored it until i was certain it was actually C doing it. i didn't really know what to do i mean i was never taught about sex (due to our school system failing us) and it felt sort of good but also sort of weird. this went on for about 20 min. and then i held her hand and C put her hand down my pants and did things for a bit then abruptly stopped. C had a partner and C told me C felt like C cheated and i reassured C that it was ok and that we don't have to talk about it ever again and we can pretend it didn't happen and this relieved C.

&amp;#x200B;

then a couple of years later i decide to end it with some of the people in the group, including C, because they're toxic. C then, after telling her this, tells me that I r\*ped her that night and told everyone imaginable that i was some rapist monster. everyone shunned me and i was completely alone. C told their relatives and they wanted to talk so then i told my parents and it was the most embarassing thing to have to explain. we eventually moved away and i'm starting to find peace but being told i r\*ped somebody when really i was the one who was sexually and mentally taken advantage of has given me severe PTSD (i've seen a therapist about this for about a year now) and also developed into a host of other problems.

&amp;#x200B;

the biggest problem i have is that i fear so much to go out in public. i fear that everyone knows and thinks i'm disgusting and ontop of all that i feel disgusting. my body was basically used and thrown away by C and even after C did this to me and told the school i was a r\*pist, one of our mututal friends who still talked to me told me C said that i ""had a nice d\*ck"" like what the fuck. i feel so much shame and  violated, uneasy, disgusting, etc. and i've felt like this for almost the majority of my life now because i had no way to cope with it or deal with it healthily until seeing a therapist recently. i feel so damaged and i blame myself honestly for even getting into that situation to begin with. i wish i could've gotten away but it seems like C will always loom over me and have power over me because C is a ""victim...""

755;755;2571_ptsd;"A lot of things I don't understand that haunt me every single day... when I was 19 I fell in love with a guy who I had no idea was on meth and he got me started on it. I was on paxil at the same time. I instantly became addicted and a friend who hung out with us then says she remembers I was constantly ill and sleeping and that the guy was giving me pills all the time, she said he told me they'd help me feel better but now I think it may have been something to keep me doped up so he could bring people into the house, I have a memory of him bringing a friend and the friend was smoking heroin and I was too out of it to care at the time. I lost the apartment I was living in due to not paying rent and I ended up with a friend of his that lived in the complex and was also a tweaker and much older than me. This is where it got very bad, he was very sadistic and verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. He told me he was intentionally trying to make me go crazy, and he would just stand there and smile and taunt me when he got me to the point of crying. He talked about ways to kill me, and weird things like splitting my mind and making me reborn and being one of the ""elite"" by being tortured. Just really insane and confusing and he kept me in a constant state of anxiety to the point where I would have panic attacks when he wasn't home, especially after I found him hiding in the pantry when I thought he had left... he was physically abusive as well but it went deeper than the ""normal"" abuse because he would have a totally different voice, different face everything when he would talk about that weird stuff it literally scared me to my core because it was like being talked to by a demon... and he made me feel so dehumanized and worthless, he told me there were all these things wrong with me and I developed a fear of going outside which lead to me being trapped in the apartment with him for 7 months. I believe he drugged me as well as revenge for having him put in jail but that is a whole other long and horrible story. All of this happened in a short period of time. 

My memory is really messed up when it comes to all of that. I don't know exactly when it began, and there are huge chunks of time missing. I actually had a point where I just ""woke up"" but I was sitting in my bed, I didn't remember ANYTHING for several minutes and even as things came back to me, I had this horrible weird feeling like my name and my room were not mine. I didn't know what I was doing before that and my bed and the furniture were moved and I still don't remember moving anything. I have never understood that but when this happened I returned to the abusive guy (I was all alone, as an addict he was the ONLY person who still talked to me and at that point I was convinced that I was crazy and none of the things he did happened) and he acted all emotional and told me some weird stuff about how it finally happened and that ""Caeley #1"" has died and I was now ""Caeley #2"". It made me feel more alone and terrified and I now wonder about the possibility of having DID (I had traumatic things happen as a child) or if it's part of PTSD and depersonalization/derealization disorder I've been diagnosed with. 

Another thing I wonder about is why I am so emotionally detached from my memories. I remember it like it happened to someone else and I was watching, not like it happened to me. It makes me wonder if I even have PTSD at all. I only hear about people with PTSD being fearful and crying and everything but I am not like that, yet it still affects me and my life in other ways. Until recently (I think having a baby has changed it) I was unable to cry. I talk about it constantly, I think about it constantly, but it's the same memories over and over and I feel nothing when I think about them, just disturbed by the lack of feeling. I feel like not feeling anything makes it even harder to move past it... it's like I'm stuck. Like I blocked out the emotions then when they got too horrible to deal with and then I just stayed like that. I cry about other things, I feel love and everything but I'm totally detached from the memories. I factually know how I felt then. I know I was in absolute despair and so much pain but like someone else TOLD me how they felt. 

When I talk about this stuff, I do not feel any anxiety at all, but my back tightens up and I begin shaking and getting cold, every time. When I'm talking about it out loud, if I go on too long the tightness in my back spreads through my body and makes it hard for me to breathe and I have to stop talking. Once I stop talking about it, it goes away. It has made it difficult for me to explain everything to a therapist. It's very weird and I'm serious when I say I do not feel the anxiety whatsoever when I talk about it... it's just my body reacting that way. When I was typing what happened, I got those physical symptoms and when I started typing this, it faded away. Is it still PTSD if I am emotionally detached from the memories? Is there a type of therapist or someone that can help me connect to those memories and move past it? I was seeing a counselor in my home town but I got married and moved, and she wasn't helping any way because she didn't understand what I meant when I told her about the detachment. I just really need peace, and to move on. I feel like I'm just trapped in these memories until I feel like they were real... as weird as I know that sounds. I hope someone out there understands.  This drives my husband crazy and he doesn't know what to do :(";1
178;178;838_ptsd;A night that still haunts me So me and my girlfriend had decided to take acid around 5pm one night. We felt like having a little bit of fun, but only took one tab each so that I could still drive and we could just cruise around all night tripping. So skip ahead some time and at this point it was around 3am. We were driving on some back roads in a country area. We felt this was a good place to stay because it wasn't populated and no one else was on the road. There was also no police that came by this area usually. We took a turn on a road and started heading down it. This was a road we haven't been on before. It was very dark, no street lights. When we turn a corner I see blinking lights from a car and then I see that the car was smashed into a tree. I was tripping balls at this point, but I felt I couldn't not go and see if anyone was hurt or not. I pull up behind the car and my girlfriend begs me to not go. She is tripping harder then me and thinks that I am going to be attacked or something and I was going to get killed. I calmed her and just reassured her I was going to check and I'll run back to the car if anything happens and to leave it on. I walk up to the car and I can smell gasoline and burnt rubber. My heart starts to beat fast as I approach the door. When I open the door I instantly felt sick. Already tripping the sight I had to just behold almost had me at my breaking point I tried not to cry. There was a mother and her daughter in the front seat. The mothers head was bashed in part of her skull had con caved into the rest of her head and there was blood dripping all over. There was a strong metallic smell. I immediately went over to the daughter to see if she was still breathing and to my horror when I checked her pulse there was none. I felt like I couldn't hold myself together. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. I began to break down and I could only say that there had been a crash on the road that we were on and I hung up and took off. By my reaction my girlfriend already knew what must have happened. What haunts me the most is that the car must have been sitting there for a long time. Just sat there maybe the girl was still alive for awhile and no one was there to help her. Maybe if someone had seen it earlier she would've lived. By the way that the blood was coagulated when I came it must have been there for at least an hour. I'll never forget this night ever.;0
874;874;1684_ptsd;"A nightmare fueled week venting. Obvious NSFW or TW or whatever. Sexual abuse TRIGGER WARNING

Hello, I haven't used my Reddit for quite some time now and I've been having a crazy week filled with nightmares every night. So, instead of walking out of my room and speaking or texting my mom or someone who has a common past trauma thing... I post here while crying my face off alone in my bedroom trying to cry quietly so no one hears me. 

I close my eyes after sitting for twenty minutes saying to myself that I can't think of those things over and over. The moment my eyes shut I see a few scenes from my childhood. One of which surfaced after not showing it's face for quite a few years. I sat up horrified and had to refrain from screaming. I thought I had forgotten it after all this time. Nope. Of course not. I never forget that shit. 

Behind my eyelids I saw my brother digging up something fuzzy and lumpy from the ground in the forest right by my grandmother's house.
 I feel sick just typing this but here it goes. On the shovel there were bones and a larger lump came up and I saw the fur of an animal. I was an extremely gullible child who had followed my brother and it took me till seeing the fur to realize this is where we had buried our cat Smokey. A Siamese who I loved with all my heart and had to be put down because of a rare condition I was told was passed down from his mother. I don't know the truth but I'll just pray that's it. 

I immediately starting crying after the realizing it was my Smokey and ran crying to my mom after having my life threatened if I told. I don't even remember if I told her. That's sad. I hope I did. The movie behind my eyelids starts as fast as it started when I close my eyes for a second time. 

The instant it starts I see me and my brother hidden under my bunk. Me with my pants down cringing at something my eyes won't show me. I'm so thankful that is a blurred thing to see. In this scene I always remember my grandmother walking in the room and realizing we are under the bed together. I had prayed and prayed to a god I don't believe in that my grandmother would take him away from the same room and whoop his ass and cuff him but it was never spoken of... I don't even remember how old I was, my school counselor narrowed my trauma to starting age five. I guess she had talked to my mom over the phone about the apartment I described to her. Middle school was the last time anyone spoke of those things.

I am not the best at typing on this broken phone. I thought that typing here would somehow help me if I got my story, well a fraction of it, out there into the atmosphere.. this is only a snippet of the horrors I lived through while around my brother. My dad to this day tries to win him over and loves him so much and my mother has him under her wing at all times. No one talks about that shit. Everyone loves him so much while I sit here sleepless half the time over the torture I've lived. He probably sleeps soundly every night of his disgusting life. Having to wake up to my kids is the only reason I'm still here. Holy shit dude....";1
70;70;52_ptsd;"A poem about my experience. Hi everyone,

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*but I did not comprehend.*

*Jacket-less, I shivered as the rain began pouring.*

*The memory fades.* 

*I came back to myself.*

*The blood cried out the horror,*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*It cried these things to me and many more.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions* 

*with no one there to answer them.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My mom, my brother, my step-father waiting.*

*Mom sobbing as we embraced.* 

*The bullet pierced my heart again*

*My father was not the only one shot that day.*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

*The car stopped, and the dam broke.*

*Blood, tears, and terror erupted from within.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I understand now, truth at a bitter price,*

*that fear is a sacred thing*

*and always has been and always will be.*

*The world was a Different place there.*";1
563;563;493_ptsd;A shadow just set me off. It's 1 AM. I'm sitting here minding my own business and I see something that looks like a very large person walking past my living room window towards my front door in the dark. Two lamps are on in the living room, the front porch light is off, front porch window blind is 100% open. Side porch light is on. Streetlight is on. It takes me a full 15 minutes after getting my gun and checking all of the windows and door locks to calm down enough to even consider it's something other than a person. I'm still not confident it wasn't. Though my driveway alarm didn't go off, that's not impossible. Unlikely, but not impossible. To people that don't have PTSD it's difficult to explain the sheer panic your body goes into at a moment like this, and the time it takes to calm down and snap back into reality. I broke down in tears. I should be able to sit in my living room without freaking the f out because of a shadow. I guess I'll be shutting my blinds from now on. Good Grief. ;0
132;132;1335_ptsd;"A Walking Amnesiac Does anyone else have no ability to make memories? I don't remember anything, nothing episodic at least. I can remember semantics and if I tell myself something enough times I'll hopefully remember it. But when I try to think back to even yesterday, there's just a void. I might remember the fact that I went somewhere but I won't actually be able to recall a memory about it. There's just nothing there. I've always been this way (I know not because of memories but because of stories I've told myself). I never really thought about it being weird until I was in college but now I I know it's definitely not the norm. I have ptsd but I don't actually remember what happened. I grew up in an abusive home until I was 17.

Does anyone else experience this? Particularly to the degree of nothing being remembered? I feel. Like a walking amnesiac.

445;445;528_ptsd;Acceptance is hard I was deployed to Afghanistan from 17’-18’ during that time, I saw things most people do not. A friend hit by a rocket, countless rocket and mortar attacks, and helping call in allied ordinance to kill enemy. By no means are these very drastic by military means. These are quite literally the job. However, accepting these moments, and issues that they have brought have been harder than I’ve thought. Today I mailed out my disability claim with the VA for PTSD.  What hurts me with that, and even with having feelings about what I have done, is that it’s nothing. It’s a scratch compared to veterans past and present. And I feel horrible for feeling bad about shit. Let alone claiming a disability. Honestly I’m looking for someone to validate my feelings, and tell me I’m not being a piece of shit for claiming benefits.;1
688;688;2491_ptsd;"ADA Accommodations - Shadiness Hi All! 

I know this might not be the best place to post - but I'm wondering if any of you have had issues when requesting ADA accommodations for your PTSD?

Long story short - I've been with my current employer 5 years; I am in an executive-level position and have had 5 years of great performance reviews; Late 2016 my PTSD ratcheted up after I was flooded with childhood sexual trauma memories; I took FMLA in January 2017 for the full 12 weeks, returned to work part time for two months, then full time since.

In August 2017, my manager decided I needed to meet with her to discuss accommodations for her made-up ""Essential Duties"" of being in-person at a single meeting per month. I clarified with her that attendance at the meeting would be my highest priority and asked for a full roster of needed ADA Accommodations. She agreed with most of my suggestions, we implemented a plan that's been working since. She was asked to follow up with HR on my request that all PTSD-related absences be excluded from the policy (she raised that I was ""getting into trouble"" with the policy and she would have to let me go if I violated it). I never heard back, so didn't worry about it (she has always been very lax with the attendance policy for all in the department).

Flash to February 2018, I have my first high-symptom call-out day (8 hours) in a while (about 3 months). Boss reviews all my absences since my return, and asks for documentation on two from 2017. She says it is because I'm bumping against the company policy for too many absence occurrences in 12 months. She is only looking at PTSD-related events, as the two times I had the flu this year didn't spark any kind of review, nor did non-PTSD absences last year. I ask her about the policy exception we discussed in August, and suddenly she's on the defensive. She responds that there is no exception, and decides she told me about this last year. It didn't happen, so I ask for documentation. She can't find any.

Last Monday, I had a meeting with HR to ""formally"" open my ADA accommodation request. Per the company, this is the first time I'm asking for anything, because my boss never brought my August conversation to HR, nor educated me that there was additional steps to formalize it. I meet with HR, I give them an updated list of accommodations, they give me paperwork for my doctor - no problem.

When I look at the paperwork, the job description isn't mine - it is for a coworker in another department. I send a copy of what I have on file, and ask for confirmation it is correct. A WEEK LATER I am still arguing with my supervisor and HR as they keep insisting I hold a job that I do not (completely different scope than my actual job, as actually described in the JD I have from 2 yeas ago). My job description now needs to go through the full HR review process and be approved.

**TL/DR and Ultimate question:** Are they trying to screw me? The culture at my employer is one of intolerance/purposeful ignorance of PTSD and its impacts. They do not take this seriously, and continue to set arbitrary ""blackout days"" that I ""cannot have a high symptom day on"" without risking my job. As you know - this is nearly impossible to agree to given the variability of trigger events. I think they're trying to let me go... am I being paranoid or could this be their shady way of saying I'm in a job that doesn't exist so am ultimately downsized and they avoid the ADA protections?

Throwaway account because my boyfriend follows me .

Hello, I’m not exactly sure this will be beneficial for me but I  need to try I guess . From the age of 5 till the time I was 13 my cousin would  touch me and his sister. Fingering us “playing doctor” telling us that since it hurt it was our fault and something was wrong with us. See my cousin was caught with his sister but since I was so embarrassed I never said a things leading to her getting the help and therapy she needed while I dwelled with this self hatred for allowing it to continue so long.  I finally snapped and was hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I opened up to the psychiatrist as much as I felt comfortable doing. Which wasn’t much. Anyway I bounced between plenty of  therapists before giving up on therapy all together I’ve never really learned a good way to cope. (I had my first thoughts of self harm again recently and that’s scary to me I don’t want to fall back down that path) 
I recently got into a new relationship and I’ve never had a problem with this until recently. My mind likes to play this game where it twists the truth and so it has lead to a trust issue between me and my boyfriend. Which led to the flash backs returning, and it’s at very hard times like when we’re going to get intimate break down and start crying. Which makes me feel like complete shit as my boyfriend doesn’t deserve it.  he’s very patient and understands since I opened up to him about what happened. He stops right away to make sure I’m ok I just don’t feel like it’s fair to him (or myself)  Anyway I guess what I’m asking is how do I go about releasing this pent up trauma and how do I help myself cope?";1
576;576;797_ptsd;"Advice after gaslighting 
For 3 years straight, I had a friend who kept me wrapped around his finger. 

I was not allowed to be friends with certain people without the suicide card being pulled, I would be constantly demeaned and harassed for anything I would do. Within minutes, I’d be love-bombed. This person made me believe I had their trust. Everything I did was always wrong, and I’d be at blame for everything, and 5 minutes later I was the best person in the world. I was stalked, he had to have tabs on me wherever. All conversations were passive aggressive. 

I am terrified of this person, legitimately terrified. Everyone that they surrounded their self with hates my guts because of what they told them I’ve done. I didn’t do anything but because of gaslighting, I don’t know if I was the abuser or not. I tried to help but also take up for myself. I never belittled them or hurt them deliberately.

Everything I see is skewed now. I’m terrified I’m an abuser. I’m terrified I’m a horrible person but I know I didn’t do anything wrong. I’m paranoid I’m being watched wherever I go.

I haven’t spoken to them in 5 months, and I’m in a great relationship. Every day I worry when they’re going to come back into my life and destroy it all. I can’t live in peace. My birthday is on the 3rd, and I have a feeling that’s when they’ll come back. Does anyone have any advice or can anyone offer support? Everything is appreciated greatly.

998;998;1802_ptsd;"Advice I have recently been suspecting that I may have PTSD but I feel like I haven't ""earned"" (I don't like using that way to classify trauma but I cant think of another word) 
In 2017, after the suicide of a friend of mine, my ex boyfriend emotionally abused me into a relationship with him again. In December, he sexually assaulted me (not rape.) I didn't consent but at the time I felt like since he was my boyfriend it was okay. I've come to realize that it wasn't okay and I was violated. 
I have been having horrible nightmares of the incident, of him committing the act in another way, of him being in my life, of everyone dismissing that he was abusive because they liked him (which happened irl.) When I see someone with a patchy beard like him, curly hair like him or a car like him, my heart stops. I cry all the time when I even think of a physical relationship. I have panic attacks even seeing someone with a similar side profile. If I hear his name or see his photo I just relive memories.

412;412;578_ptsd;"ADVICE NEEDED: relationships and ptsd Before you start reading: I do not intend to offend anyone at all and I logically know that all men are not bad people, this is just simply sharing how my twisted mind functions because of my past and asking for ways to cope or advice or just to know that I’m not alone. 

I was raped throughout my childhood by my father. He is no longer in my life as an adult. However I still suffer from ptsd due to the trauma. One thing that starts happening to me when I go through an episode (episodes may last days) is that I start becoming disgusted with men. This includes my boyfriend. The fact that he ever wants to have sex with me or that he looks at porn or has any sexual thought whatsoever absolutely disturbs me. I want nothing to do with men at these times and don’t even want to be touched by my boyfriend. Thing is, he is a really nice, supportive man that I’m very lucky to have. He doesn’t ever deserve to be seen that way. I think he deserves someone who is more normal. But if I were to break up with him because of this so he can have better, then I feel like I will just have to stay alone forever because that means that everyone deserves better. I’m so frustrated and I genuinely do not know what to do";0
495;495;836_ptsd;"Advice on family members who are triggers Incredibly brief background: I have Asperger's and experienced emotional trauma from my childhood and upbringing.

I'm in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. I have recently begun talking to my family again over email after avoiding contact for a year as I needed to distance myself from them. I have a great deal of trauma attached to my birth name which I no longer use and they put very little effort into understanding this and not using it when talking to or about me. I also have trauma associated with my upbringing and my family's behaviour to me as a child.

The conversations were over email and it felt as if they had begun to be more understanding of this. Recently my Mother came to visit me and after about an hour into her being here, I noticed I had begun to feel extremely nauseous, very anxious and uncomfortable, to the point where I really struggled to focus and maintain socialising for the rest of the day and for the rest of her visit. I had a really hard time falling asleep because these feelings did not subside and instead had gotten worse, leaving me up overthinking to the point of crying and feeling like I needed to throw up as if I had something stuck in my throat.

Even though they have not purposefully me any wrongdoing and that I still love them as family, I feel as if I would be putting myself through more than it is worth and more than I can deal with if I continued keeping in contact with them. I feel great deals of guilt when considering cutting them out of my life but I honestly don't know if there is a better option at this point other than doing this and seeing a therapist.

People say that you are meant to remove from your life things that are triggering for past trauma, but what do you do when this trigger is a person, especially a family member or members?

I am really stuck here, sometimes I feel as if I am being over sensitive and nasty about this, but other times I feel justified and this is the right thing to do for myself.  I can't tell if I am being unreasonable/unfair or not and would really appreciate a second opinion on this.";1
503;503;743_ptsd;"Advice on medications and therapy I have been struggling for PTSD for 6 years. It's destroyed me and the personalty I used to have. I'm a very angry, paranoid, and bitter person now. I'm not who I was 10 years ago and I honestly don't think I will ever be that man again.

For the last 4 years I've been self medicating with alcohol every day to feel calm and not so keyed up and paranoid. 

I was able to quit successfully on my own, I've been sober 16 days today. Not one drink (this was not easy at all)

But I'm struggling now more then I ever have, My PTSD seems worst then I remember it being before I started drinking to manage it. 

I'm angry, paranoid, anxious, depressed, and hypervigilant to the point of near exhaustion. I just feel like giving up and going back to drinking. I feel like these feelings will never go away and I can't function like this, I either need relief by using alcohol again or I need to see a doctor. 

The problem is I'm very paranoid of people and their intentions and I do not trust doctors at all, I also am apprehensive about telling them everything (or anything for that matter) because I feel like they won't keep things between us. I can't repeat the things that cause me hurt and pain to myself, Let alone another person who does not understand what I've been though and had to do. 

Deep down I do want to get all those things off my chest but I'm afraid to talk about them. I also don't like being stigmatized as crazy or weak because I am a man. I was raised in a very conservative household and I was taught not to cry, show weakness, or talk about trivial things like how I'm feeling or how things make me feel so talking about feelings is very alien to me. I just don't know if I can tell someone I don't know or trust everything.

I've considered just going to a psychiatrist instead of a therapist so I don't have to talk about anything. 

I just want relief from these feelings. 

If anyone has combat induced PTSD, Can you give me advice on what medications to ask for?

Any advice would be great.

90;90;776_ptsd;"Advice to help with car accident ptsd I (19F) have been in 3 car accidents since I got my drivers license when I was 16.. the first one in April 2016, 3 months after I got my license, I rear ended a stopped car at a red light stop going 35 mph. I went to slow down and my body just went completely lifeless, my vision went blurry and was almost as if I was in a Minecraft game (weird I know)

My second car accident was in August 2017, a year and 4 months AFTER my first accident. I got t-boned on the driver side in a parking lot. I was stopped had my blinker on waiting for him to go by so I can turn left and the man who hit me didn’t have his blinker on but I saw he was turning right. Well he turned right as I barely began to turn left and he came completely in my lane t-boning me. 

Then my last most recent accident happened January 2018. I was driving my Ex’s lifted F-250 truck, it was our moving weekend and he worked out of town at the time so he was driving his commuter and I was driving the truck. Well it was raining and we were taking the back roads that lead to the main hwy. Well we were coming up the hill with a slight curve and the speed limit is 45 mph and I was going about 35 mph maybe 40 mph due to it raining and I barely put pressure on the gas during the curve and the bed of the truck starts hydroplane fishtailing.. everything starts going slow motion and the front passenger tire hits a curb and the truck flipped and rolled  5-6 times about 70ft down a steep hill that dropped off into a river. I instantly thought I was going to die in that car accident. 

With those being the accidents I’ve been in I’m absolutely 1,000% terrified to drive on highways, drive in the rain, drive long distance. When I drive on the hwy I constantly feel as if I’m hydroplane fishtailing. I start to lose my breathing, my body goes numb. I absolutely REFUSE to drive in the rain unless I’m in my hometown and not on the 2 main highways. I hate driving long distance because I get a really bad rush of anxiety and feel like something bad is going to happen if I’m driving. 

Sorry for the long post. I’ve tried all the grounding techniques, having lavender scented air fresheners/ essential oil in my car, talking to myself and telling myself I’m okay. Does anyone else have this problem? Will I eventually get over my fears and overcome my ptsd? Any tips and advice to help get rid of it? TIA";0
61;61;57_ptsd;"Advice: Are these signs of PTSD? Or do I have something else? Hey, everyone! I wanted to share here because this sub looked so supportive and because something has been plaguing me for a while. I just decided to make a new account since I couldn't hold this in any longer.  
Trigger warning for some; child sexual abuse, crude jokes  
I recently went through an involuntary hospitalization (related to perceived suicidal ideation) and some of my typical behaviours and quirks caused a psychologist to take me aside and ask if I potentially had PTSD. I assumed she wanted this information to diagnose me or put it on my precautions sheet\*. While curious, I prompted her to share why she thought so, and she replied with, ""I noticed you've been very startled at loud noises throughout the day. At times, you would stare into space and that concerned me."" Now, I was curious. Although I had a fair share of PTSD-knowledge, I mostly comforted myself with the fact that a lot of them are veterans and just...nullified the possibility of me having it.   
Now, the quirks I demonstrated were, as aforementioned, me jumping at loud noises and loud voices, being sensitive to touch, and also a strange blanking out. I don't remember what one would call it, but it strikes me as a whelming of thoughts about my ""trauma"" (which I'll explain below) and I can't help it when I'm in it. I feel like I'm there, but I don't hallucinate about it. It's just all the feelings of it, and it feels *terrible* when I have these spouts. I don't know if flashbacks are like this, but I'll read more around this sub and try to pinpoint the exact definition of whatever a flashback feels like.   
So, my trauma. To put it short, I was raped by two guys (one over the age of consent, and the other almost there) at the age of 11. When I was 13, I was molested by an uncle. I'm 16 now. I've just been trying to deal with it by...joking. That's the only coping mechanism I have. I, at times, even joke about my trauma. Once, I joked about how I ""need to keep my grades up, otherwise, I'd just be a sex doll."" It hurts, though. I can't stop thinking about how the incident was and sometimes I'm a ball of tears because of it.   
So, what do you guys think? Should I just get over it, or do I have PTSD? Or do I have something entirely different? Thank you so much for reading.   
\*A precautions sheet is a sheet with all the patients on it and why they're in the facility. I just wanted to let you all know just in case you didn't.";1
289;289;943_ptsd;"After an intense PTSD episode, I arranged a visit with my childhood sexual assaulter and I am so grateful that we got to chat For background, it was a one time occurrence that happened when I was 7. His parents are friends with my parents. He had always be at the back of my mind, for years after the incident.

When he showed up to the event that was hosted at his parents house, (I should note that he has moved out a long time ago and so I was not expecting him t show up) I locked myself in the bathroom and bawled my eyes out. How would he react to seeing me? Would he even recognize me? What will my parents think of us being in the same room again since the incident? What will his parents think?

So I stayed in the bathroom, constantly psyching myself up to get out, but then failing to open the door. My mom knocked on the door and said, “is it because of ___”?!? as if it shouldn’t affect me anymore. (Cue eye roll). I said yes. We left the house.... 

ANYWAYS...

after that event, I decided that I had better meet up with ____ to see him in a different way. Holy cow, he is nothing like he was 11 years ago. I see him in a completely different way. It seemingly didn’t affect him at all, he never thought of me, which was a disappointment, but I think he was sorry once he realized how much i was hurt by the incident. Yay me for being so brave!";1
771;771;1861_ptsd;"After clinic I think I don't have PTSD, but that doesn't help in any way I was officially diagnosed with PTSD about three years ago. I was hospitalized for it. My therapist told me I have this Disorder for many years, and that's why I struggle. 

(Is it even possible that I kinda have that since I was a toddler? Because I had the symptoms since I can think.)

So first I really thought: wow, now I know why I'm such a fuck up and now I can do the real therapy and be normal for once normal.

Boy, I was wrong. The time in the clinic were the worst. The clinic is specifically for PTSD sufferers. And yeah, I like to talk,and I talked to many people. Most people didn't say anything about their trauma and what they suffer from and I think that's the right thing to do in such a setting, I think it was even the rule. But you know how it is, some people told me the worst you can imagine. Told me what happened to them. How they suffer. How they hallucinate. Basically told me their life is an ongoing terror. All I was answering was like: oh I'm so sorry. I didn't have it so bad.

(Before I went to this clinic I was in a general hospital, there they told me to NEVER talk about my trauma until I'm in the PTSD clinic.)

When I finally had my trauma therapy session. I told her everything but I didn't feel it. It was like I don't care. I apologized and said I am wrong here.

I still am sure I do not have PTSD. A new therapist even told me laughing in my face I don't have it. I don't have vivid flashbacks. All I have is this mental void I get suck in. In this dark hole, where I can't get out. And nightmares.


It really gave me a form of relief when I first heard my diagnosis, like I know what I have to deal with now. But now I'm... just existing. I don't have something to fight, just myself.

I am really open about not having PTSD, I don't get mad if you tell me you don't think I have this, actually I feel like an imposter and I am angry at myself that I post here and take the support away from real PTSD survivors.";0
613;613;1156_ptsd;"Agitation I live with ptsd from sexual abuse. One of the many difficult things about my experience with ptsd is the agitation. Who else experiences this?

Cannabis helps a lot and I do meditate very often, but what else has worked for you guys?

Now I'm comfortable driving but I'm a nervous wreck in the passenger seat when someone drives by. When I hear brakes squealing my heart begins to race and I can feel myself getting upset and I might cry. When I see a car accident or a crash happen sometimes it makes me upset, depending on how severe it is. Especially the fake car crashes on tv.

I understand that it'll take a long time to recover from it but could I be suffering from PTSD or is this just a long recovery process?";1

930;930;1740_ptsd;"Am I overreacting? I was diagnosed with PTSD after leaving an abusive marriage. I feel pretty good most of the time, but still have triggers. I feel like my relationship with my boyfriend is strained at times because of my triggers/responses even though I’ve tried to explain it to him. 

For example, he sometimes reaches out and touches me while he’s talking (like when he’s making a point). Last week, I shrunk back from his touch and he looked at me like I was the Antichrist. I told him that I don’t like to be poked or touched unexpectedly, but he still didn’t seem to understand. This has nothing to do with him and it’s a reflexive response for me. 

One major trigger for me is violence, screaming etc. in movies...especially in the evening or near bed time because I have nightmares. I’ve left the room before and gone to watch TV in the bedroom when he and my daughter were watching a scary movie and there was no issue. I’ve told him many times that movies can be triggering for me. Last night, a movie came on where a woman was getting ready for a bed and a man in a mask was lurking outside. The music got ominous and I knew I had to get out of there FAST. I quickly went to the other room and turned the TV on to drown it out. I could feel my heart racing and my breath quickening just imagining what was happening on that TV in the other room. If he wanted to watch that movie, I was ok with it, I just couldn’t be in that room. He came in and told me we needed to have a conversation about communication and how those situations could be better handled in the future. I told him that I left the room quickly because I knew something was coming and didn’t want to see/hear it since it was close to bed time. I said it had nothing to do with him and I wasn’t angry or anything. He continued to try to have a conversation about communication with me in that moment. I resented it. I feel like I did what I needed to in that moment to feel safe, and because it made him slightly uncomfortable, he was forcing me into a conversation I didn’t want to have. He implied that I wasn’t an adult.

I have been suicidal at a number of points in my life, am an alcoholic and have done a lot of shitty things over the years to deal with my trauma. I’m now almost 4 months sober and am really trying to be better. Leaving the room felt like the right thing to do in the moment and was a lot better strategy than things I have done in the past. I can’t always articulate how I feel and I don’t always want to. I don’t want to always have to explain why I need to leave the room. It’s really discouraging to feel like I’m making progress and have someone treat me like I’m overreacting or a child. I know he means well and that he loves me, but it’s discouraging.";0
371;371;786_ptsd;"Am I pathetically overly-sensitive or is this a PTSD symptom? Summary: PTSD diagnosed after abuse (emotional and physical), rape, ongoing stalking/harassment. 

Am I just a crybaby or something... I spoke on abuse support group about my feelings and a woman attacked me, told me I was nasty and I brought other people down to feel good. It was evident I didn’t do that in the post (I mentioned my ex cheating with sex worker and she took offence to the fact I mentioned her occupation, I wrote no opinion on it, just mentioned it whilst focusing on my pain). 

Anyway, being told I was nasty... I cried for a hour. I felt suicidal. I felt insanely low. ALL because some stranger online was rude?? That’s pathetic and not normal and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

Part of the verbal abuse i experienced was being told repeatedly that i’m a evil/horrible person. So i don’t know if this is a trigger? But is this even possible if I feel I’m over the insults from the abuse???

I had an abusive ex and one of the last things they told me before finally leaving is that I was far too broken to be in a relationship and that they had gone out of their way and took pity on me and that I should be grateful. Largely they’ve proven to be right. I’m terrified of intimacy and terrified of being touched. I’m terrified of closeness. I badly want those things but I feel physical panic. I was always mocked for this in my previous relationship, which only made it worse.

952;952;1868_ptsd;"An inability to trust My PTSD was caused by my mom abandoning my siblings and I when I was 16.  It was later exacerbated by my husband deciding he didn’t want to be married anymore one day out of the blue. 

These two events have made it so that I am a needy and incredibly insecure shell of the person I used to be and it’s costing me a potential relationship with a man I care for very much. 

My mom left my dad when I was 16 because she wanted to be with the man she was cheating on him with and left her 3 kids behind because some stranger was more important.  We didn’t see her for months after she left and when we did it was just for a day and she was always drunk or *he* was there. 

My ex-husband would punish me for my feelings and emotions and would spend days and week and sometimes months neglecting and ignoring me only to then spend a day or two piling attention and affection on me until I was happy and then he’d go back to ignoring me.  He spend our first wedding anniversary ignoring me in favor of playing video games with his friends, he’d tell me he was going to play D&amp;D with his friends only to later tell me that he actually went to a kink party.  He manipulated me emotionally, he would gaslight me, make me feel as if I deserved all of the awful things he did, he would force himself on my sexually and then make me think that it was okay because we were married. 

So we are divorced and two years later I meet a man who is wonderful and so nice but he doesn’t want anyone to know we’re dating because he’s afraid his ex-wife will find out and try and take his son away from him.  Except it’s been 7 months and he sometimes doesn’t answer my texts for several hours, we can’t go anywhere if someone who knows us will be in case it gets back and he avoids answering my questions about where the relationship is heading. 

I hate it. I don’t understand what I’ve done to deserve this.  Why can’t anyone just love me? I just want to be with someone and feel safe and happy with them.   If my own mother didn’t even want me why would anyone else? 

I hate myself. I hate my life. I just want to be loved by someone.";0
1041;1041;1541_ptsd;"An Issue I Have... Hey. New to the forum. I'm Magnus. CSA ""survivor"" (if you could consider what I'm doing surviving, then go ahead). and I have an issue.

I am inherently a very loud, extroverted person, but I just can't seem to vent about certain things. No matter how hard I try. Like I know what the vent would be about. I'm hypersexual, and I have issues with my gender and my religion. But the sections where I write out, even in a private journal where no one can see, feel such an immense panic that I just can't get it out onto paper.

I get that this is common, and most people can just suck it up and move on, but because I'm such a loud person, I've established a status quo with people that I will come to them when I'm upset. That's why when these things cross my mind and start throttling me, I want to be able to go to them and talk about it, but I get overwhelmed with such a large amount of panic that I just can't function. I feel like I'm denying them, or that I should tell them.

But it's not like I can just go on hiding it forever. It's a persistently invasive part of my life that has consistently made me very upset on a number of occasions but what am I supposed to do? Vent? (haha) So it's like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. There's nowhere for me to go, and I'm not currently in a place where I have access to therapy.

301;301;1074_ptsd;"Another terrible anniversary. Woke up crying. I'm ashamed and I hate myself. (Sexual abuse and violence) I missed the primary elections two years ago because two years ago yesterday, my ex dislocated my arm in three places in the wee hours of the morning and threw my car/house keys into his lawn in the dark and rain. I was still trying to get it back together because I couldn't explain it at the ER and I didn't want insurance make me have to face him in court. I should have seen it coming. Three months before that, he screamed in my face and grabbed me by the shoulders. I ignored the blazing red flags. I still experience daily pain. Roughly twelve hours before that he'd shoved me over the couch (I have a serious back injury which I finally had my spine fused for recently, and that has long been a huge no no for me) and yanked my pants down to try to fuck me while his 4 y.o. daughter was in the bathroom. He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly. I was shocked because he hadn't done anything like that in the 11.5 months we'd been together, but as a testament to my prior experiences with abuse, I saw it as nothing terribly abnormal. This was what I'd always known relationships to be, whether it be family, friends, or intimate relationships.

I was supposed to move in with them in a couple weeks. I wanted to wait until a year in, because I knew deep down he was a bad guy, but I wanted to be wrong. I wanted to be a mom (I can't have kids), and I wanted to save his daughter from the life I had growing up. He used this all against me. He's a narcissist and has some severely anti-social tendencies. 

Last night I had a nightmare involving me babysitting for him and his ex-wife, and their friends drugging me to rape me when they brought the party home. It brought back all the bad and my husband (we met two years ago next month) has super-hearing abilities and heard me crying while he was in the bathroom getting ready for work. He came out to hold me. Now he's gone and I'm crying again, damn it. It brought back all the memories of all the physical and sexual assaults and rapes I've experienced. People like that can smell a victim a mile away. 

The shame is so overwhelming right now. That I let it happen. My entire life. From the first time I didn't say anything aged six. I just want to forget. I don't want to feel these people touching me. So many people, so many times, I've literally lost count. The things I've let happen because I never understood that people who love you don't hurt you like that. Things I let happen because I was conditioned to believe from such a young age that that is what life is. Hiding, hurting, and being used. Because I never saw the value in myself as a person. I still don't. I'm a garbage person. 

My husband was the first to tell me that it wasn't normal to let myself be an object. A fuck toy and a punching bag. I had just accepted my fate that it was my place to be used and abused. That my normal was to live in fear of being hurt or fucked. I was 34 when we met. Now, after all the years of being used like a Kleenex, I feel so dirty, ashamed, and undeserving of someone as wonderful as he is. I feel like if he truly knew all that had happened, all the things I let happen, though I've shared a lot with him, that he would be disgusted. He's a better person than that, I know. But I feel unworthy of love, and unworthy of the safety I have with him now. This morning I told him I often wonder if I'd met him sooner, if I'd believe him or just brush him off as some bullshit fairytale who would eventually hurt me in the same ways. It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that.

I'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all. A couple months ago I asked my psychiatrist if ECT would make me forget. Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. 

Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner. ";1

829;829;2439_ptsd;"Anyone else here have PTSD related to a physical injury that can never be repaired? Edit: sorry I realized I probably should have put a trigger warning in the title. 

#[TW: Physical injury of sexual organs, medical negligence, suicide]

Look in my post history for more details (on /r/suicidewatch), but the basic gist is that I had surgery a few months ago, and the surgeon managed to amputate my sexual organ. I'm being vague here with vocabulary because I'm intersex and my anatomy is unusual, but I'm a guy and still have a penis, but it is not the source of my sexual sensation. The organ that was amputated was.

I previously had issues with trauma, but it was all the kind that was easy to dismiss as not being severe enough for PTSD. This is on a whole new level, and I'm seriously struggling with functioning day to day. The only way I'm able to is to shut everything related to this event out of my mind. I feel like I'm swatting flies in a dump. I'm completely numb most of the time, because allowing any emotion in opens the floodgates to the horror and pain of what happened to me, and it's just absolutely unbearable.

I'm struggling to see how I can live with this, or how it can ever get any better. I've lost sexual function, and have this constant physically painful and uncomfortable reminder on my body of the trauma that was done to me.

How on earth do you cope when you cannot separate yourself from the source of trauma, and it will never go away?";0

544;544;252_ptsd;Anyone else with CPTSD/PTSD have these issues with therapy? So long story short, i’ve had more smaller events of sexual abuse starting when I was 12, possibly earlier, with a very neglectful and toxic mother and family. I had a bigger trauma when I was 16 where i got dragged out of a car and let in the middle of nowhere. It wasn’t until I was 20 I got the diagnosis of PTSD (also bipolar) after years of trying to figure out what was wrong with me. I started going to therapy, but the prolonged exposure didn’t work. I didn’t want to do it, because it just made me uncomfortable. I have panic attacks and the fear and real emotions come when I don’t expect it at home, but i was never able to get any emotions out in therapy. I couldn’t even really have full memories of the main traumas. My therapist always tried to get me to cry and break down but i never could. I eventually just gave up and stopped going because i started feeling better. He was confused and thought i was running because we didn’t do any real PE work. I feel fine but my husband also thinks i’m running from it. Maybe i’m manic, maybe i didn’t have ptsd, maybe i just got better by myself, and maybe all i needed was someone to validate my traumas and give a shit about me. I just don’t know if anyone else has had this because it’s very confusing and i’m not sure if i’ll relapse soon.;1
753;753;2503_ptsd;"Anyone have elevated heart rate related to PTSD? I have my heart rate spike when I have to do things related to my PTSD. If so, how is it treated? PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE QUESTION IF YOU CAN, EVEN IF YOU DON’T READ THE REST!



Here is the long backstory you don’t have to read, since I really just want to know how other people have treated elevated heart rate related to PTSD:

I’m afraid I’m about to end up being treated for a heart condition I don’t have, as I only have heart rate spikes temporarily when my anxiety is triggered. It used to make me agoraphobic because I was so convinced I was going to have a heart attack and die &amp; really interrupted my ability to function &amp; would go months at a time without leaving my house at all. I worked through that and although I still get the racing heart when I have to do things that relate to the PTSD, I am able to tell myself that it’s temporary and will go away when the situation is over.  I used to take 6 msg of Xanax a day just to get out my front door and now I don’t need anything. 

Problem is that I also have ADHD which I do require medication for...I get goldfish brain to the point I had 3 car accidents in 3 weeks off medication. At my last visit the guy I saw had issues with my heart rate and told me to see my pcp &amp; get clearance to continue on the medication I was taking. I’ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don’t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn’t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn’t be enough and he’d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don’t know what to do.  

On top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I’m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I’m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we’re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they’d be better off because now I’m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control. He made me fill out the depression questionnaire (I was previously treated for major depression with TMS &amp; am on Prozac still) and I answered honestly about thinking my family would be better off if I was dead nearly every day and I was going to tell him that I was feeling very guilty about the impact of my mental health on my family. But he never picked up or even looked at the form. I left truly believing my family would be better off without me because now everything is about to get much worse for me and therefore them. So I’m obsessing about dying suddenly but also thinking I should die for the sake of my family. 

This whole event just upset me so much it made me start thinking about the whole traumatic event again in detail.and how unfair it is that the person that caused all this did 6 years in prison but got to move on with his life. And here I am 20 years later feeling sentenced to life. I know I’m going to be right back to having flashbacks and panic attacks and seeing his face in every stranger. I really wish I could restart this day and never go to that appointment. 

All of this could be over if I could just not have situational heart rate spikes but he offered me no solutions to what I can do about that. I’m hoping someone here has had similar issues and how you handled it. It’s not related to the medication because I’ve had this for decades even unmedicated and I purposely didn’t take it the last 3 days out of fear of this exact thing happening. So even if I just didn’t take it anymore, I’m still going to have these spikes that he says could stop my heart.";1

446;446;253_ptsd;"Anyone here actually responsible for their trauma? **Yes, there's a TL;DR at the end. Sorry for the essay.**

**Backstory:** I was diagnosed with PTSD years ago. I then developed panic disorder and other issues. Less than a year ago, I was re-evaluated and the persisting symptoms that were originally attributed to PTSD were instead attributed to a different diagnosis. I initially straight up refused to accept the new diagnosis as it was made by an external therapist who didn't and still doesn't really know me. I still am not convinced I fit the criteria for it, and the more I read about it the more I suspect some of my traits and behaviours were grossly misinterpreted and 'bent' to fit the criteria. PTSD is still what makes the most sense to me. Hence why I'm posting here for now. 

About a month ago I was in a really dark place and didn't know what to do to help myself. I created this account and joined this sub, the CPTSD sub, and the sub dedicated to my current diagnosis. I was hoping I could either come to terms with my new diagnosis or find more evidence that I might have been misdiagnosed to use as future reference, once I'll be able to choose my own therapist. 

I can't say I achieved any of that. I feel lost, confused, trapped. But after a month+ of lurking, reading, trying to make sense of things I did figure out the number one factor preventing me from feeling like I fit in - here or in any of the three subs. I believe it's the fact that I'm completely responsible for my trauma. 

And no, I am not a victim of abuse convinced it was their fault. My trauma was objectively my fault. It wasn't intentional, I didn't mean for it to  happen. But it did, and it was my fault. 

I guess when I joined I was really hoping to find even just a few people with a similar 'profile' as me, somewhere on Reddit. No such luck thus far. 

**TL;DR:**
Is there anyone else here, PTSD diagnosed or not, who can objectively say the trauma they experienced and have been suffering from was the direct cause of their own actions? 

Whether intentional or not. 

I am honestly desperate to find people that can understand this guilt. I feel very alone rn. Please, do reach out if you can identify with this. If you don't want to out yourself commenting, I understand. Please consider DMing me. I am a good listener. You don't even have to tell me your story, I understand it can be shameful and painful. Just a dm saying you're in the same boat as me would really help right now.";0

995;995;1456_ptsd;"Avoiding EDMR because I’m worried it will make me kill myself [30F] Trigger Warning I’ve been getting professional help for 16+ years for long term depression, anxiety, and self-harm all independent of any trauma. 10 months ago I got PTSD from watching the person I loved most in this world suffer to death against their will (no right-to-die legislation in my state).

It was recommended that I do EDMR but I read that EDMR has you recall the events and I’m worried that if I purposely recall the events that I’ll kill myself. Everyone tells me how much EDMR helped lessen the severity of their PTSD but it doesn’t work immediately, right? So after that first session when I’ve just recalled everything I’d be extremely at risk, right? But on the other hand if I keep avoiding this treatment then the PTSD will never stop.

I don’t have any friends or family nearby who can babysit me. I’m in the US so I don’t get time off work and I can’t afford hospitalization. I’m worried that if I bring up this concern that I’ll be involuntarily committed. 

Not to mention that part of my PTSD comes with a complete distrust of hospitals, doctors, nurses, all of it. I can only trust hard data from actual test results which has already led to a statistically unwarranted biopsy that I needed to get or else I’d lose my mind but who knew you had to be awake for biopsies?! They messed up the procedure and I had to hear the whole conversation that basically went “oops we need to get another doctor in here to fix this” and I could feel all the blood running down my ribs and it’s like, what the actual fuck doctors truly are idiots. If I didn’t have so much experience cutting I’m sure the incision thing would have f’d me up too. The lump was benign.

The PTSD isn’t too bad if I just avoid everything but mornings are rough from nightmares and trying to reconcile my reality again.

TW: rape, sexual abuse

\-A little over 2 years ago, my ex raped me. There had been about a year of sexual abuse leading up to the rape. The manipulation and gaslighting and little things like forced kisses and groping fucked me up just as much as the actual rape.

\-A few weeks later, I met my current BF and fiancee. I truly believed he saved me from further abuse. He helped me cut my ex out of my life.

\-My BF is my ex's uncle (though they are the same age, they're family), but they are not in contact with each other and don't interact with each other's immediate family frequently.

\-I have had a lot of trouble trusting people after my abuse, My friendships are mostly people who my BF is friends with, people who he trusts I believe are safe to be around and I am more comfortable around them.

\-My BF's two close friends are dating each other. They have been together for years. I thought they were in love. They are extremely good friends with my BF, and I liked them and was very interested in being close to them as well.

**THE INCIDEN**T: My BF's good friends were apart for a few days. One of them told my BF he cheated on his partner with My abusive ex. My ex has told their friends that He raped them. 

I am in absolute shambles. I have spent years avoiding contact with my ex. Now not only have my friend destroyed his relationship to ""have sex"" with him, but I believe my ex was raped by him. I have to cut off a friend who I tried so hard to warm up to and put myself out of my comfort zone to interact with because I discover he is a PoS. And now my rapist is coming to me wanting help after they have been raped. The poor partner who has had their relationship destroyed is coming to me for help. I believe my ex is going to tell their family about what happened, which includes me since I am engaged to their uncle. 

It has never crossed my mind to blame somebody for being assaulted, and I am not blaming my ex, but I really disgusting, horrible, ugly part of me can't help but be glad that they can experience all the hurt they caused me.";1

586;586;988_ptsd;"Became abusive myself after emotionally abusive relationship I’m a 22 F and severely ashamed of my situation. I lost my BF whom I love with my whole heart just before 2020. It ended up in him saying that he does not want to deal with me anymore, that I have a part of me that is absolute trash and that he is done trying and does not want to contact me anymore and just wants to find someone else to love to repair what I broke. That crushed me.

So I went no contact for 2 weeks now, even though it is very hard because I have so much anxiety about people leaving me. And have send him a loving message stating that I still want to try my absolute best to improve to get him back, even though I already told him when he broke up but he wasn’t interested then. But who knows... right? 

Since I have send the message today and he did not respond but saw it anyway, I started scrolling through old convo’s. And I can’t believe... what a monster I actually became. I threatened with suicide or shared suicidal thoughts when having extreme anxiety attacks. Putting him on trail: ‘If you do this, I’m going to die.’ And even though I actually felt like that in the moment, reading all of it back makes me feel like a ansolute failure. I have hurt the person who I loved the most time and time again because I was so filled with anger and pain and I could not cope. So in stressful situations, I turned into a manipulative version of myself. 

My first boyfriend was very emotionally abusive and used the same tactics. He completely isolated me, told me I was the most amazing person ever, then proceeded to tell how what an absolute crazy bitch I was who deserved all the bad karma in the world, talked me up about how he loved my red hair, then blocked me everywhere one day without answers and proceeded to date my then BFF (who colored her hair red which was weird and funny). That relationship left me with many scars and I started drinking because of it, as well as trying to find love in the wrong places. But I thought that after some years, I escaped the trauma.

I recognize today that I never did and could not cope with my emotions which made me have extreme anxiety attacks, anger issues, no impulse control, manipulative behaviour to get what I wanted... Also towards my parents. I would say towards the people who support me most and were closest to me.

I turned into the monster that I had despised so many years. How can I ever make up to my now ex BF? How can I try to repair the relationship and gain back his trust? But most importantly, how can I grow as a person from this and make sure I NEVER EVER EVER use that behaviour as a coping mechanism?

I acknowledge that I am just very anger and sad towards the world and this makes me lash out the way I do, but it made me lose the one guy I truly loved. So how on earth can I actively work on myself, love myself and stop myself from doing what I did?";1

I cried most of the way through that episode and then off and on since watching it. I'm left feeling awful.

270;270;778_ptsd;"Being a young mom with PTSD When I first had my daughter I was unaware I had PTSD. I had shoved my childhood abuse in a closet to never look at it again.

But after months of sleep deprivation, fixating on having to be the perfect mom and excessive paranoid thoughts of my beautiful child dying or being kidnapped I was coming undone at the seems.

My husband pushes me to go to therapy and I learned that my erratic moods, my paranoia, my insomnia... just every little thing that made my life hard was real. It wasn't just me defective, born wrong. I knew I could do something to improve my life and my daughters.

However anger is a huge problem for me and one time when my daughter was about 1.5 years old, she was being a kid. An I just lost it, I screamed at her at the top of my lungs and slammed the kitchen cupboard so hard it broke off its hinges. The second I turned around and saw my daughters scared face I broke down.

I asked myself how I could do this? What kind of mother scares her child? I held her close and I promised myself I would die before I ever let my anger scare my child again. But its not so easy, the anger comes faster than I even have time to process whats happening and it bursts out of me. When I was young I used breaking this as a way to vent it, but I can't any longer go around destroying crap, especially not in front of a 2 year old.

My solution now? Lay down on the floor. Literally as fast as I can, lay down flat on the floor, face down and take a few deep breaths. Tell myself ""you're mental illness isnt who you are"" over and over again. When my daughter stops throwing a fit, or doing whatever it is that has dried up my patience levels and sees me, I pop up and go ""peek a boo"". She then laughs and goes ""again!""

The point is... My biggest fear is my mental health causing my child to be scarred, to have a broken childhood. It feels so good to take a moment I am not emotionally in control and turn it into something she sees as so innocent. She's too young to know that mom isn't perfect. Right now she wants mommy to be her perfect hero, and God dammit I'm gonna be that for her.

i still deal with PTSD like symptoms such as strong twitching when thinking about my past or very sad subjects. im especially sensitive to things like that. if im at work im distant from others and if left with time to wander in my thoughts, i will think about dark stuff and flinch very noticeably - and others might ask why i do that. it's embarrassing but at other times i feel completely okay, even happy, can function for days no problem. i even have the habit a bit contradictory to the sad thought flinch - just thinking of little jokes and i'll laugh out loud - and of course that's embarrassing to as i seem like a crazy person to my co-workers. i guess i have a strong pendulum of emotion and react strongly to it. other times its long bouts of apathy. 


so im thinking about getting therapy / help again. but even looking around on websites and thinking about getting that help upsets me. i flinch pretty hard but not even on certain hard memories, just vague memories of the multiple occasions when i had a bad time in my past. i think PTSD, if i really do have it, probably blurred my memory on certain bad things. i also can't find any good info on this stuff. i don't know if i should get therapy or not either - money is a problem for me and therapy brings out the worst emotions. i don't want to feel those bad emotions, its very painful.

209;209;1396_ptsd;"Boundaries and Parents (Semi Rant and Seeking Advice) Hi all, 

I have PTSD and anxiety and have been working with my Therapist to not only set boundaries but also put myself first (I tend to put others before my needs and burn out). Boy is it hard. 

I  had a rough month last month. Got hired on into a new job, Dad was diagnosed with cancer and had surgery. Fiancé went through issues that triggered his anxiety and on top of all of that I’m working on healing from my trauma and all the spin offs from it (I’m a assault survivor and the anniversary just happened).  I’m going through some of the darker parts of what happened in therapy and it’s draining on me. 

Also add that my mom leans on me for support and I had to talk her down from anxiety in relation to my dad while trying to deal with my own pain and emotions from it.

Rough month right? 

I finally hit a wall, I just needed a break.  I had to be strong with all that was going on and it hit me hard.  And yesterday I felt that straw break.  

In the middle of all the craziness that was happening at work yesterday, my mom calls me...my step grandmother has cancer (bone) and I just couldn’t. I didn’t want to hear it at that time.  I had shut down. 

I couldn’t provide the logic my mom wanted to hear. She didn’t even listen to me when I asked her to stop. She just kept going on and on about what cancer it was and what may happen next and how everyone is upset.  I actually snapped and yelled stop. I told her I could not process right now and that I need a break. I asked to let me had the night and we can talk about it the next day.  

Her response was to tell me that “I could just find out about it myself” and hung up on me. 

I’m angry, hurt and shutting down, please tell me others have felt this way too. ";1

487;487;947_ptsd;"Boyfriend triggered me today (accidentally) My boyfriend was driving us around today in an area that he is not familiar with but I am very familiar with, as I used to live in the area. Anyway, I was directing him as we went along and there was a bit of a communication mixup. I told him something like ""get into the left lane and turn, not here, but at the next turn,"" but before I finished the sentence he had already started turning. Then he swerved into the other lane to correct himself.

This caused me to apologize profusely and once we were in the right lane he was like"" gosh, get better at giving directions!"" which immediately triggered me. My ex used to constantly undermine me and especially my sense of direction. I started crying and hyperventilating. My boyfriend of course, was just joking (we ~fake~ get mad at each other all the time) and felt so bad.

I'm so mad that I can't just joke around with my boyfriend without being triggered. And it's the most random things. Giving directions, picking a movie to watch, etc. It makes me feel guilty (for making him feel bad) and it makes him feel guilty (for making ME feel bad) and then it seems like he walks on eggshells afterwards.

660;660;2666_ptsd;"BPD and IFS therapy I started seeing an IFS/internal family systems therapist the past few months. We did a lengthy “test” (I can look up the name for anyone interested, forget at the moment) and the results came back and said I had PTSD and Disassociative Identity Disorder with mild Borderline Personality traits. 

For years and years I was treated for BPD. I’ve done two DBT groups and only saw Borderline specialized therapists. I started IFS because I felt I needed to address my underlying trauma as opposed to the daily “dealing with emotions.” 

I do feel a bit lost about a new diagnosis. While I identified a lot with others with borderline such as feeling empty or being super emotional, there are some qualities I really don’t have at all - but I know everyone is different.

1085;1085;2637_ptsd;"Broke up an intense fight at work, need advice I'm a teacher at a, for lack of a better term, urban public high school. I've seen and intervened in my fair share of fights. Last week was different though. I came out of my room after dismissal and saw two boys going after another in the hallway. Teachers were already there, but the campus security was outside dealing with another fight. Right as I entered the hallway the two boys started swinging at the other. The teachers tried to apprehend the two, so I went and grabbed the other one holding him up against the wall.

What I didn't realize is that I had grabbed the one who didn't want the fight to happen, so when the two boys broke free from the other teachers I ended up being a human shield. It's all a blur after that, I just remember them yelling in my face and throwing fists at me and the boy I was protecting. Eventually, other people got involved, but I couldn't move or I was putting the boy in more danger. The only injury I have is a bruise inside my lip, but after my adrenaline settled it triggered some other trauma I have from my parents growing up. Today at work when I looked down the empty hall I almost burst into tears.

What suggestions do you have so that I can go back to my normal self? I've always had trouble with people coming up behind me and I already know this will make things worse.";1
107;107;1191_ptsd;"Bullying gave me anxiety, anxiety made me an alcoholic and drug abuser, alcoholism gave me chronic gastrointestinal pain, and chronic gastrointestinal pain gave me intense homicidal feelings. I dropped out of school during my last year of high school because of extremely high levels of anxiety. This severe anxiety disorder started nearly a decade ago, because of the bullying I went through in middle school. I suffer from uncontrollable panic attacks (I would qualify those panic attacks as small heart attacks, given their intensity).

My first real panic attack happened back when I was in 8th grade (in 2007) and my phone got stolen from my backpack during PE. This might not seem catastrophic, but with this phone, I (stupidly) recorded myself jerking off while I was bored a few months prior , and I didn't erased the video (I know that it's dumb, but I was 13 at this time, and teens do stupid shit all the time). I completely forgot that this video was still on my phone's memory card, so when I figured out I got robbed, I was just angry about losing my phone, and about not knowing who stole it. I didn't realized what was about to happen. So I got home, (I lived with my mom back in middle school) told my mom that my phone got stolen, and she called the telephone operator to deactivate the sim card. To me it was no big deal....

The real drama started the following day, when I got back to school, and got laughed at by literally almost a hundred kids. I didn't understand why everybody was laughing hilariously, and then someone said to me ""I saw you beating your meat dude !"". I still didn't get it, then I remembered about the video I filmed a few months before with my phone, that I didn't erased.

I got ridiculed for the rest of my middle school years because of this, kids called me various degrading names, like faggot, pervert, wanker, weirdo etc.... During this time I began to sweat a lot because of anxiety, so I smelled like sweat all the time, so people humiliated me because of it, for example, one day during a math class, a girl complained to the teacher that I stink, and that she doesn't want to sit next to me, because my body odor makes her gag, of course everybody started laughing at me, even the teacher had a smirk on his face, but the teacher didn't let her move to another place.

I got beaten a lot, because I used to be skinny and short as a teenager, so I was an easy target, I got violently beaten countless times in the locker room during my middle school years, someone spat on me once, It is extremely humiliating to be spat on, I got treated like a pariah, like a punching bag (and I never reported it to the school administration or the police, out of shame, I never even told my parents about it to this day, and I regret not doing it, because there could have been an investigation to find out who stole that phone). The video was shared phone by phone, via Bluetooth, so my entire school saw me choking the chicken (seriously !).

I live in Martinique, an island in the middle of the caribbean. This island is part of France, so I'm French, but Martinique is a very ghetto and rough place. Living here feels more like Jamaica, or Brazilian favelas, than France. I've been to ghetto schools. The schools I went through were very ghetto-ish. The kind of schools where kids do drugs at 11, where a good portion of the girls get pregnant before 18. It is very traumatizing to get beaten by 5 or more kids. It feels like your manhood is taken away from you. People pick up on anxious vibes, and treat you like garbage because of it. Now I have PTSD from all this physical and verbal abuse.

The bullying greatly diminished in high school, because I went to a high school away from my hometown, where nobody saw this video. I moved from my mom's house to my dad's house, but the damage was already done. In high school, I got teased a little bit because people could notice my severe anxiety, for example people in high school used to tell me that I walk like I have a broomstick stuck up in my ass, and other hurtful things like that, but it was nothing compared to what I went through during middle school.

Because of all of this, I stupidly became a full-blown alcoholic during high school, to cope with anxiety / depression. I also heavily used drugs. This heavy alcohol and drug use led to all those health problems I have now. I want to commit suicide because I suffer from extreme anxiety, agoraphobia, chronic stomach pains and severe headaches. I went to a GP, I explained to him all my symptoms, then this GP sent me to a gastroenterologist, a neurologist, and a psychologist. The psychologist prescribed Xanax and Klonopin, and I did CBT for 4 months, but it didn't help me. The gastroenterologist and the neurologist got multiple tests done on me: A gastroscopy, MRI, blood tests, etc... but unfortunately they didn't figure out what's wrong with me.

I'm currently unemployed, I live with my father, and he is threatening to kick me out of the house. He has been very patient with me, but his patience is running out. I totally understand that he is not immortal, and he wants me to be independent, I don't hate him or anything, I love him, but how can I hold a job when I'm severely physically sick, and I have no diplomas, because I didn't graduate from high school ? From these years of intense bullying, I developed an extremely severe anxiety problem, and even almost 10 years after this happened, I still struggle with even basic human interaction.

This made me completely hateful of people, even though I know not everybody is a piece of shit. This left me in a state of perpetual, uncontrollable anxiety. I absolutely hate every single human being on Earth. If I do get a job, I will die from a stroke or a heart attack because of anxiety. I tried to get a disability allowance, but it got rejected TWICE. I lost pretty much all hope, and I feel like going on a killing spree at this point. I feel like going to a place where a lot of people gather, then cowardly killing as many people as I possibly can, The only thing preventing me from going on a killing spree is my belief in some form of reincarnation after death. If I go on a killing spree, there's only 2 options afterwards:

OPTION 1): I surrender to the police, I get sent to prison, and the prison where I will spend the rest of my life is a dirty, severely overcrowded mess. There's no protective custody there. This prison is organized in dorms, each one full of 40 to 50 violent people, high on crack/meth, HIV positive, murderers, thieves, rapists, etc.... I don't want to go to prison.

OPTION 2): I commit suicide to avoid prison bullying, but unfortunately, instead of finding eternal peace, I'll find temporary peace, then I'm going to be reborn as some creature on another planet somewhere far away from Earth, maybe as a penguin-like creature, and instead of having a good time in my next life surrounded by my new penguin friends, I'm going to get gang raped and abused because of bad karma. Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vs1d0fNEsE) poor fellow. What goes around comes around. I can avoid human justice easily, but unfortunately, I can't avoid the Universal justice system. I hate this world.

Just gonna lay it all out, I know not all of it is especially traumatic. In that time, there were about a dozen cases of physical violence, but none more severe than causing some bruises, however often it would be in front of friends or teachers. She threatened to kill herself I’d estimate 12-15 times, and said about half a dozen times that I would “die young,” and that she “would laugh.” For a long time she made me feel sexually inadequate until I gave in and performed acts that she wanted but I wasn’t really comfortable with yet. There was a lot of emotional stress as well, as she wanted me to be constantly texting her, she had access to my phone’s location, she didn’t want me hanging out with friends and family, she would gaslight me, say that actually I was abusive, make mountains out of molehills, and probably more that I can’t remember right now. 

I’ve been experiencing a lot of the symptoms of PTSD, but I don’t believe that I’m capable of self-diagnosing, and for the time being I’m not in a place where I’m able to seek therapy, but I’m trying to get more perspective, because it’s kind of ruining my life.

2014: I received heart surgery and woke up during the surgery. I didn’t think much of at the time, as I don’t recall experiencing pain but tbh the memory is pretty fuzzy now. Cue, panic attacks, debilitating anxiety, blurry vision, horrible memory, extreme hypochondria for the next 5 years. I am a shell of the person I once was. 

I am now reading up on ptsd following waking up during surgery, and I seem to fit the description. I’ve been in therapy since but not until my latest therapist was the idea of ptsd, rather than plain old anxiety discussed. I never felt anxiety the way it was typically described to me. What I feel can maybe be best described as extreme discomfort, like I want to jump out of my skin. I disassociate from the horrible sensations I am feeling. It’s so inexplicable that I have trouble even describing it to doctors which just makes things worse. 

The ssris just seem to numb me up enough to be functional but I refuse to allow this to be the rest of my life. I will fight this. I want to get better and I’ll do anything to get better.

So, I've been dating a guy for 9 months. The first month was like a fairytale, he behaved good and I thought that he is a nice guy. But a month later he was in a car accident and it was his fault. He and his friend were almost dead. After a month in coma, he survived and there was nothing much changed in his behaviour towards me. He couldn't walk, use his hands either. I was next to him, but all of a sudden, he started abusing me, verbally. As a result of his abuse and the anxiety caused by that car accident I lost 11 kg (which is much because I am now 43kg, I was 40 when I was with him and with anorexia). In may, he raped me. He hit me, he used to lock me in his apartment after work and beat me. In june, he told me that I should leave my house. My parents were hitting me too... I didn't know what to do, so I left my house and this was my biggest mistake. I was with him 6 days. I lost kilos, he argued with me. On the sixth day, I told him that I wanted to go home.

I just want to acknowkedge that life just really fucking sucks sometimes. And it's tough. And exhausting. And frustrating. And full of chaos and unfairness.

I've had a difficult life. Not as difficult as some but just a lot of bad unfair things happening to me and me not deserving any of it.

I've been burned (when I was 3), emotionally abused by my mom, hit by three cars (all from distracted drivers...i was actually stopped in the 2 recent ones and people just hit me...causing concussions and disc bulge and severe whiplash), abused in a toxic relationship, dealt with depression, self harm, anxiety, and had a pulmonary embolism because of birth control. I'm 34. What else is life going to throw at me??

I mean wtf?? I'm so tired of getting knocked back. I've had psychological issues and possible PTSD from the trauma of getting burned as a kid...and my mom never addressed it. She kept saying that something was wrong with me and I needed to get fixed (that I was broken). Well...duh! I suffered trauma at a young age. Then because of her emotional neglect and abuse I've spent the majority of my adult life working on my self worth and going through therapy.

When I think life is good...I get hit by a car head on in 2016. I now have chronic pain. It was so hard dealing with all that pain and the hopelessness and depression and PTSD. But I got through it. I started to heal. Then I got a pulmonary embolism in 2017. If the outside world wasn't safe...surely my own body is safe? Wrong.

Now I had PTSD related to body sensations. Being on blood thinners for 8 months was horrible. I felt sick and weak and scared all the time. But I got through it. I went to therapy. I processed. Then again life was seeming okay. I was healing and getting more safe.

Then I get hit by another car. Rear ended while stopped behind a bus and pushed into a pole on the side walk. This was June 2019. I've had vertigo and neck pain. My poor brain and body can't take any more of this trauma. My emotions can't. It's hard to drive. I get scared at any fast car around me thinking how easy it is for one of them to not pay attention and then kill me. Maybe the next one will kill me because life seems to want to do that.

I'm just really tired. What'll I do? Just keep existing until something else traumatic comes along.

My relationship with my bf may also be ending. Not in anger or drama...in sadness that sometimes it just doesn't work out. That love isn't enough when two people have opposing needs or values. We love each other but that doesn't mean it'll work.

I wish I just had an okay life. That I grew up in a supportive household and that I don't know what it's like for an 800 pound object to be speeding towards me, completely helpless in every way.

904;904;2475_ptsd;"Can PTSD develop due to seizures? Hello everyone. I’m sorry for the wall of text. I’d like to preface this by saying I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, nor have I experienced anything life-threatening, but at the time of the experience I couldn’t tell what was going on. I’ve just noticed huge changes in a lot of different aspects of my life recently, and I’m looking for answers; google searches gave me results about PTSD leading to seizures, which is the reverse of what I’m looking for. I’ve done lots of research into what I’ve been feeling and how I’ve been behaving, but I hit a roadblock here and so I’m helping you guys can advise me a bit.

About 3 months ago, I had two seizures in one night. A few weeks prior to that, I had one seizure, but that was nothing compared to the doubleheader from right before Christmas. The first one occurred right after I used the restroom late at night; I turned around after putting the toilet seat and lid down, and sort of blacked out visually while retaining semi-consciousness. I fell onto the side of the bathtub (luckily the curtains stayed up, haha), then slid onto the floor, completely out of control of anything. I was even making moaning noises and saying “no” repeatedly, but neither of those actions were voluntary. I was too tired to even move from the floor, and my right leg and right arm were hurting terribly, but I couldn’t tell you whether it was on account of the fall or muscles spasms. 

After what seemed like an eternity (but more likely around 5-15 minutes), I managed to get up and limp to my room next door to the bathroom, but no sooner had I closed the door than I collapsed halfway onto my bed frame and slid onto the floor again. This one is what I think the trauma stems from; I couldn’t see or hear anything, and all I could feel was as if I was being electrocuted (if you’ve ever used one of those machines that applies shock to a specific muscle, it was like that on maximum power throughout my whole body). I have no idea how long it lasted, I just know that I could feel my vocal chords crying out without actually hearing them. By the time I regained hearing, I was mumbling “turn it off” over and over again, and the whole thing seemed to end right as I finally clearly yelled, “please turn it off,” aside from the arm/leg pain, headache, and profound confusion.

1108;1108;1400_ptsd;"Can PTSD lead to psychosis? Here I am again. I've been posting on reddit before about my severe anxiety and fear of psychosis.

But still, as a background note:
I am a 23 year old woman, currently unemployed, with no history of psychosis/schizophrenia in my family, but with history of trauma (bullying, abusive father, parental divorce, neurological illness of my twin brother). I'm currently living with my mother and twin brother.

So, because of the whole covid quarantine, I engaged in online therapy. I contacted a clinician psychologist  via a mental health website following a video evaluation and a series of tests for diagnosis. 
After all of them, I scored very high in most anxiety disorders which are: PTSD (highest), health anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and OCD.
I also did a psychosis test which came out with 0 points result, meaning that I have no hallucination or delusion.
She adviced me to continue talk therapy and (optional) medication but accentuated the talk therapy. 
 I'm currently still trying to save some money for the upcoming sessions so right now I can't attend them.

The thing is this: for the past month I've been dealing with derealization and been stuck inside my head all day.
I have a huge fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia after accidentally coming across on google while searching for symptoms of dissociation.

As mentioned, I don't have hallucinations or delusions, but I experience some things maybe related to my PTSD. For example:
- when my brother doesn't answer my phonecalls I get a panic attack and racing thoughts about something terribly happening to him (he is diagnosed with epilepsy).
- I tend to avoid songs, places, movies, topics that remind myself of my trauma experiences, otherwise I think they might reoccur.
- I have a tic that's lip picking, when i'm stressed or bored.
- I have agoraphobia due to a traumatic event when I passed out 5 years ago (due to hypoglycemia) and always go out feeling tense and stuck in my head.
- when I get derealization, I struggle to focus on my surroundings and my speech.
- when I send a text to a friend or say something that might upset them, I think about that a lot of get scared of them wanting to distance from me (it happens only ocasionally, but it's still concerning me).
- being stuck in my head, I became a bit less responsive to conversations with my family.

My traumas were triggered when I was 9,13,14 and 18.
Ever since the evaluation, I began to think a little more clear about my mental state but I still have the psychosis themed fear and the idea of losing my mind or losing control of myself terrifies me.
In the past year my self esteem has been very affected, I don't feel in control of myself and feel like I lost my independent life; I feel the need to rely on my mother and brother. Before that, I used to trust myself and my mother and brother relied on me too. They still do, but I feel like I'm the one who can't rely on myself.
All of this happened after getting the psychosis fear.

I read somewhere that PTSD can come with secondary psychosis in a much higher rate than in general population and it scared me badly considering my phobia.
I feel like I need more information on this, as my fear convinces me that because I have PTSD, I might get psychosis too.
Are there any important details about this? Does psychosis in PTSD manifest the same way as in regular psychosis? Why do some PTSD sufferers develop it and other PTSD sufferers don't?
Does my personal case suggest I might develop psychosis?";0
282;282;281_ptsd;Can someone please reassure that I’m not going to get killed? Long story short... I met my friend Timothy four years ago on this gaming chat site. We became great friends.. no odd behavior was shown by him.. we would text for hours about games, our scores and how we can work our way up the leaderboards.. well, that normality went on for about two years. On the third year, Timothy started exhibited odd behavior. He insinuated he was into illegal porn and stuff like that, but I took it as a joke because he would always joke around all the time. (By now he has my phone number) That went on for the rest of the year. On the fourth year, he would joke around about raping minors every day of the week. He did it for about six months.. then some idiot leaks my first and last name to him and state, so then that makes me paranoid. By then, I block him and I haven’t spoken to him in a year. It’s been a year.. blocked Timothy on all social media, I removed all my online shit, I’m totally ghosted. He never said he would hurt me... and he probably understands why I left.. I think. Maybe not. Anyways. I’ve been having paranoia all year that he’s going to come after me and kill me for leaving the friendship. He never said that though. Is this a form of PTSD? Will he really track me down with my first and last and kill me? His toxic behavior makes me paranoid enough to believe that even though I know he won’t... but I need reassurance. Please help me. I’m tired of being paranoid. ;0
443;443;107_ptsd;Can symptoms worsen once you are in a safer environment? I've experienced prolonged abuse since childhood including domestic abuse in adulthood from 2011-2016. I started to experience my first symptoms a few months after I moved into my own place in 2017 and was diagnosed with PTSD. As my life has gotten better, more stable and safer I have seen my symptoms actually becoming worse. I experience depersonalization almost daily, recently I've even started to have increasingly upsetting thoughts. I'll begin more extensive treatment next week but I guess I'm just wondering if this is normal to experience these symptoms once you are safe and if there has been any studies into why this happens.;1
849;849;1979_ptsd;"Can you have PTSD even if you don't remember seeing or experiencing anything traumatic? I'm not trying to self-diagnose myself or anything, but I do have a few symptoms associated with it. I just can't think of anything that I've been through that was traumatic. I've been startled by my mom yelling on the phone whenever something bad has happened. Like the time my sister got into a fight with her ex husband. Or the time that same sister got into a fight with my other sister. My mom always sounds like someone is getting murdered, and it really scares me, until I find out that it's not as bad as it sounded.

 Another thing is that I used to look up creepy images online. Despite being an adult, some of them would cause me to have trouble sleeping. Then again, there's a subreddit dedicated to this sort of stuff, so I doubt that's it.

 The last thing is that my mom claims my dad had abused me when I was young. But it had to be when I was really young because I don't remember any of it, and he was out of my life by age 5 or 6. Though I guess it could be because I've pushed those memories away? I have no idea.";0

He controlled my every move and isolated me from every friend and family member I had. He would tell me how worthless I was constantly, threaten to cheat on me daily, and would actively cheat on me as often as possible. He stole thousands of dollars from me and continues to stalk, harass and threaten me even after leaving over 8 months ago. I feel like I’m living in a nightmare. I thought things would get better but they haven’t. I have nightmares almost every single night about him trying to kill me and no one being able to help me.

It continued to get worse and worse, starting from disciplining for no reason and then at the time they divorced it it got to hitting with a closed fist every night. Then, 4 more years passed and my mom finally got full, but he had visitation every other weekend. As you can probably guess, it got worse. I was 16 when he finally tried to kill me by abandoning me up in upstate New York on a mountain with no food or water on a 12 hour hike (normally 12 hours). I got lost and too a long trail around and was out on my own for 36 more hours before I finally made it to the trail head and called the police. It took me so long because I had to free climb, I had to swim, and I had to drink from a river. That resulted in a very nasty virus that emptied my guts. The worst part of it though, was when he came to pick me up. He yelled at me and nearly decked me. He would have if it hadn't been for the officers there.

I am left with some issues including PTSD and depression. I am having problems lately with constant triggers, that seem very benign to others (sounds, smells, visual movements). It can be a gesture someone does. It can be an unrelated noise. I'm in constant fight/flight and very moody and can go from being snippy to breaking into tears. It's embarrassing at work. Normally I am very locked down emotionally until I get these random periods of time where I am on a downhill slide that usually has historically ended in hospitalization. But due to many reasons, I can't do that anymore.

How do I deal with this? What do I do? Living and breathing feel like torture. I am having nightmares and flashbacks. I never feel safe. I feel afraid of everyone around me even people ""close""ish to me. I know I am irrational but I've been here in the past and tried every medication with only worse results. The best that has ever been done was medicating me to catatonic state til it passes. But like I said, not an option right now. I can't go to therapy as I have no money and can't miss work to even go to cheap/free therapy but I know if I keep going as I am I will end up losing my job or worse... so it's like a catch 22.

I know the major trigger was some life changes. But I have no idea how to cope. I'm far beyond CBT or mindfulness or meditation right now which are my usual coping methods. 

Sorry if this is a bit of a rant. I have no idea where to start. It's taken me a long time to come to terms with my traumas (as in.. only the past 5 years though some date back 20+ years ago). ";0
1179;1179;2036_ptsd;"Could I have PTSD? Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.

So after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.

As I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.


So here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:

Some years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.

All this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.

Then after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.

Some time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.

Before all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.

Now after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. 

So my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?
";1
336;336;1204_ptsd;"Could this be considered traumatic? NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.

 I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.

My father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to ""discuss"" it. ""Discussion"" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining ""how things are""- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to ""misunderstand"", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a ""discussion"". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.

This was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing ""privilegies"" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and ""llike you mean it"". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.

Sometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.

I was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.

Limited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.

My friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.

I realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.

I just need to vent really. I have diagnosed PTSD from a medical trauma that (long story short) has resulted in me being terrified of hospitals/doctors offices/etc. I've been working to get over that with a therapist.

I know it's unlikely I'd get COVID-19. I know I'm probably fine. I know I could probably survive it. Other than my underlying medical history making me immunocompromised, I'm in the age range that has super low death rates of the virus. But despite that I'm panicking.

It's not the getting sick part I'm scared of - it's the going to the hospital. So because of that I'm making choices that are impacting my life - skipping work for example. I just can't get over the fear of leaving.

I'm not sure if this was the right place to ask, but I've started a romantic relationship with someone who has PTSD from combat situations. 

He struggles a lot with it, and some days are much worse than others for him. He withdraws and does not want to talk about anything, responding with short snippets. He pushes me away, believing he is a burden and will only drag me down. He sometimes asks loaded questions that indicate this. He has a self-sacrifice mentality for sure. He finds it very hard to trust me, which is okay. I do my best not to push him to talk about things he doesn't want to. He won't help me help him. We talk about how we can better communicate and figure these things out, but I'm not a mind reader. When he withdraws, I don't know how to approach him. 

He's extremely alert all of the time, jumping at slight sounds and disturbances. I remind him it's okay every time he apologizes for this. His nightmares will wake me up sometimes, and I try not to make him feel guilty and be supportive. 

I just don't know what behavior is a result of PTSD and what is his personality. He's a great person, and I don't want to give up just because of this. I understand that it's something no amount of love and care can just fix, and telling him to get over it isn't helpful either. It seems to me that there's a lot of guilt he carries, and it's hard to see that I can't convince him he's worth helping and fixing. 

How can I stay his partner without becoming his therapist? This is tricky territory, and I don't know how to handle it. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you!";1
51;51;55_ptsd;"Day 2 quitting weed, a lot of emotions (x-posted to r/leaves) Hi everyone. So it’s day 2 for me. I started smoking two years ago to self-medicate PTSD. I believe it has turned into an addiction, with me forgoing food and rent in lieu of buying weed (I don’t have a lot of money so I can’t afford this). I think it did help, but has turned into something uncontrollable at this point. I know I can manage my traumas without weed and with healthy coping skills. Today I’m feeling the weight of anger towards people who have hurt me, who have taken away my basic rights as a human being to my own thoughts and feelings. I realized just now fully that when high, it distracts me and I don’t think about all that stuff.

I’m still trying to rebuild my identity. I feel very very very small. I also don’t eat a lot because of stress and have at times gotten to under 100 pounds, which makes me feel so small and weak and powerless in this world. Completely vulnerable. I feel like certain people have taken advantage of me, and shoved me deeper and deeper into the ground, abusively controlling and judging me when no one has any right to make another person feel like this; like everything that I think, do, like, don’t do, don’t like is wrong. I lived with someone who corrected everything I did, gaslighted me, etc. There are a handful of people I got away from but never got the chance to really stand up for myself.

So now I’m looking at this life I have, no money, no car, no place of my own, underemployed…and I just think…it’s been years of being a doormat and look where it’s gotten me. I’m a people pleaser and never make a fuss with people, I’ve become mute in a lot of situations. I’ve been admitted to the behavioral health clinic several times against my will even though I was not violent and I’m literally just a tiny girl. I’ve been condescended to in those places, belittled, threatened, etc.

All of this is coming up and I feel frustrated. I don’t necessarily feel angry at these people, because they have their own problems and if they were happy people, they wouldn’t treat others the way they do. But I feel a sense of wanting to be strong, wanting to build my life, and wanting to finally have my confidence back. I have been made to feel like garbage for how I chew, for how I walk, for how I do almost anything and even though I’m not in that abusive situation anymore, I still act and feel like they are right over my shoulder and I don’t have any say in my own life. As if all my thoughts are stupid.

I do not like to feel this, I don’t like to feel angry. It makes me feel ugly and petty. I know how hard life is, even for the people who have hurt me, and I want to feel nothing but graciousness and forgiveness towards them. I guess being clear-headed today is just bringing up a lot of emotions and I’m so grateful I can share my thoughts here. I hope I will one day feel confident and strong and like my thoughts do matter. By taking care of myself, I hope I can get there. I wish wellness and recovery towards everyone here, thank you for reading :cherry_blossom:

Maybe I’m angriest at myself for letting these people have the hold on me that they did have or do have. Maybe I’m angriest at myself for hurting myself in response to their abuse instead of building.";0
54;54;72_ptsd;"dealing in triggering environments or just avoid them? advice... /please/ hello 

tl;dr: how do you deal in a triggering environment that you cannot escape? or is it impossible and you must just avoid environments such as those? 

details below

tw: very light mention of domestic violence, medical problems, men, fear

background: i (23f) have been through an inordinate amount of trauma, a large sum of it at the hands of angry people and bad men. i’m in great shape but my heart rate usually sits, resting, at around 95+. i’m nearly always in a state of panic, even though i seem externally very relaxed. this continuous level of stress is obviously not good for someone and has actually caused some really severe health problems. that being said, i can’t handle being around trigger right now and i won’t heal in doing so. 

my partner (22m) is a mental health wreck. he has a case of long untreated bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, anger management issues, anxiety disorders, unable to handle stress in any capacity, even a crumb of annoyance will set him off, bouts of delirium, psychosis, history of heavy and severe drug abuse, alcohol abuse, self harm, suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization, five or six inpatient stays with psychiatric hospitals, etc. (all of which can be remedied with counseling and med management but he never stays on it.) (in my defense i rejected his proposal for relationship for about 6 months, knowing i wanted to be alone and heal, but after about a hundred times of “let me take care of you,” “you need somewhere safe i can give you that,” “i’ll be so gentle and kind” etc. i believed him. (do not ever do that, lmao. he put on a really good show) and now we’re stuck together. our financial situation and life circumstance will keep us in the same house together for at least another year. we also have mad history and depth so it’s not the easiest thing to uncouple from. he’s currently in counseling and it’s helpful, but only so. 

situation: that all being said... i can’t handle being around his constant negativity and anger anymore... he rages a lot, slams stuff, curses, says mean things about things and people, it’s so toxic and terrible i shake everytime he’s home. he does it in the morning too, complaining about EVERYTHING. if we’re out of toilet paper it’s “of COURSE there’s no F***ING tp, oh my GOD.” when all he has to do is grab a roll from the cupboard and put it on... it’s literally everything. all the time. i can’t keep being in fight or flight mode constantly it’s actually literally medically killing me. i can’t live like this. i was in a relationship before w a man that had anger problems, and anytime he became upset like i showed above, i would end up badly injured so it’s a very potent and literal trigger that’s constantly happening. i’m sick to my stomach even right now. my dog is scared. all the time. i can’t take that. my dog. 

question: what can i do to protect and help myself? how do i bring my heart rate down? calm myself in his terror? earbuds? what else? what can i do for ME in this situation to help? i’m honestly thinking we’ll have to quietly prepare ourselves to separate in the YEAR at least it’ll take to be able to do that, but in the meantime... do i just avoid him? is it possible to heal and thrive in a triggering environment? as someone w ptsd so severe, do i deal or do i just avoid that environment entirely? 

thank you..";1
595;595;404_ptsd;"Dealing with constant sense of impending death due to various aches and pains? So I'm dealing with pretty bad PTSD from being in a severely abusive relationship(several times I thought I was going to be murdered) and some childhood sexual abuse.

I'm also unemployed at the moment and my mind is running rampant with various anxieties.  Since I've been having some legit medical issues(I've got a connective tissue disorder, nothing life-shortening but painful nonetheless, and some vertigo/ear problems that has yet to be diagnosed accurately), I'm freaking out over every little ache and pain. 

 Pulled my chest muscle and getting aches in my breast, slightly dry nipple?  It's breast cancer.  Lump in my throat, that I've had for a year and is a result of anxiety? It's cancer.  Feeling chest tightness/'air hunger'?  It's a degenerative neuromuscular disease(and totally not allergies/mounting anxiety).

I can't go a day without finding some new issue to obsess over and be convinced that I'm going to be killed by.

I've heard that a sense of impending doom, or a forshortened future is a pretty common PTSD issue.  Has anyone else dealt with something similar?   What have you found helps you to calm down and stop going straight to the worst conclusion?";1
816;816;2661_ptsd;"Dealing with personality issues I did a lot of EMDR to reprocess my trauma. That went better than expected and now it’s incredibly manageable. Almost never get flashbacks and I can cope with intrusive thoughts. 

The next thing I’m dealing with are my personality issues. PTSD can sometimes resemble borderline personality disorder and I’m looking for resources for coping with that so I can get on with people better. Has anyone done CBT for this? What was the most helpful? What insights do you have to share?

850;850;2243_ptsd;"Did anyone else try to draw their trauma and get told by their clinician they were not allowed to draw acts of their trauma, but only positive things? I used to love art in school. I'm 54 and haven't done art in over 30 years. I got a sudden urge to create on canvass; buying basic supplies and using my daughter's easel/brushes. 

I brought pen drawings into my clinical to tell the therapist how excited I feel about anything in years. I start to show that I drew rudimentary drawings of a hand choking a woman from the back of the head (my biggest fear is being attacked from behind).

 I asked about drawing during session and was told I could use her coloring tools, but was quickly admonished with ""you just can't draw anything from any of your attacks."" 

I felt so shamed I didn't say anything. Why I'm supposed to hide details of being attacked is beyond me. I went a few more times then quit when she started questioning why I kept some items in my house that helps me sustain memories of my daughter (not someone who ever attacked me.).

My prepped canvasses sit undone. Screw that clinician. I hope people reading this realize some of us have a hard enough time without conforming to your perfect worlds.

Anyway, did this happen to anyone else out there?";1
225;225;344_ptsd;"Did I have a marijuana induced episode? Hi all!

New member here. 
Basically went through some very rough stuff throughout childhood and witnessed very scary domestic abuse between my parents. Lots of yelling (my dad can be very scary) hitting in front of me, etc.
To this day my parents are still married and the physical fighting has subsided, yet they will still get into a yelling/ door slamming match every now and then that just sends me into tears despite being 20 years old. I still hate all forms of yelling/voice raising. Even when my mom is just calling a sibling from the other room, I shudder at the sound of just her yelling. 

The other night, I was smoking with my sister and her friends. I used to be a frequent smoker, nearly everyday mostly and every single day occasionally for a few months here and there, mostly to deal with depression and such. However we were taking dabs, which I have taken before without this effect, but clearly I got much more high a lot quicker than from a bowl or blunt. Anyway, I proceeded to go lay on the couch in my basement and I SWORE I could hear my dad clear as day screaming at my mom. I knew I was super high and scared, but over and over I would hear his voice in my head. I went upstairs and checked, they were completely fast asleep.

Was this some form of ptsd that was triggered by being high? Is this possible? I just felt so scared and my heart was beating extremely hard at the sheer thought of my dad yelling. Thanks guys";1

1191;1191;2671_ptsd;"Disability for veterans vs civilians I have been dealing with ptsd for 22 years. (Not diagnosed) by doctors. I was in an accident when I was a teenager and had a TBI. I have been told by family for years to go see a physiologist. I have refused for years and I am now considering seeking help. I have been researching a lot and found something interesting. A veteran in Illinois with ptsd can get  $3,300 a month and continue working a job that pays $75,000 a year and also be exempt from property taxes. Do the math on that.  
   Now, I am a veteran myself and have nothing but respect for the ones who are truly dealing with ptsd. My ptsd is not service related. I had it before I joined and have been struggling my whole life since my accident. I looked into it, and what I found  is if I were to get disability for ptsd, I can’t work.  Or I can’t make more than a certain amount a month. Am I wrong? Is this the way it is? Please tell me I am wrong. I can still work my $75,000 a year job now. That is why I’m not seeking help or anything because I’m not sure it’s worth it. If I could get what the veterans are getting I would go seek help and get on disability.

I have a lot of trauma. A very unstable upbringing and three separate accounts of sexual abuse, two of those instances were performed by family members when I was a child and the third when I was 18 years old. I have been working very hard in therapy (once a week for three years) and feel like I’ve finally broken really important ground on the unstable childhood aspect. I think that my body and my brain have made enough room for me to start really dealing with the sexual trauma in a big way. And it is ruining my life. 

I’ve found that my more recent symptoms with vivid flashbacks and memories that were foggy before is a VERY intense dizziness. It is completely debilitating. I cannot drive, leave the couch - anything. I feel like I’m going to be sick if I try. The dizziness has occurred before, but never like this. 

I need advice on how to bounce back. I’ve tried appealing the young parts by watching TV shows from my childhood (this usually works, but isn’t now). I’ve tried drinking water. I’ve tried grounding exercises. But I am still unable to move. Does anyone have any advice? 

Thank you so much in advance.";1
174;174;1108_ptsd;Do I have PTSD? Hi everyone, new to this sub reddit. I was alone when I experienced my trauma in March of 2017. Ever since I have been diagnosed with GAD and depression because of it, however, I don’t know if what I’m experiencing is PTSD. The trauma I experienced doesn’t affect me on a daily basis luckily, but if I go near the area in which it happened I experience an intense sadness and debilitating feeling of desperation and makes me cry every time. Exactly like what I felt the very time it all happened. I avoid this area entirely and will take a different route (it is near a freeway exit) but I wonder if I’ll ever get past this and be able to travel through the area without these feelings. I am seeing a therapist and am on medication for my GAD but I haven’t discussed this with her yet. Any insight would be helpful as I don’t want to say I have PTSD if I in fact do not. Thanks.;0
678;678;2082_ptsd;"Do I have PTSD? I'm sorry if I'm ignorant and offend anyone who does have to deal with PTSD everyday, but here's my story:

Ever since I joined the military 3+ years ago at the age of 23, my life has improved dramatically, I was truly happy and felt like myself. I was doing ""wild"" things like partying and clubbing on the weekends and even one night stands with strangers from the bar or online dating apps, and other ""wild fun"" things (that I prefer not to mention for the sake of my career) I would NEVER thought I'd do based on who I ""was"" prior military.

However, the happier I'm becoming the more angrier I have been getting lately thinking about my past. I'm talking about being cheerful and jolly one minute, singing with the radio driving home from work then suddenly out of no where I'll have flashbacks of shitty times in my childhood    and next thing you know I'm punching my steering wheel and clenching my jaw and just really want to fly back across the United States just to give my family whom I RARELY talk to now, a piece of my mind.

 I grew up in a conservative Chinese family. Being a Chinese male, I had a very ""stereotypical"" boring childhood and even lamer time in highschool and college. However, I was not a good student and was a handful as a child that I will admit but I have never thought that my family was abusive until lately and even talked to my co-workers about it.

To keep things from getting too long I'll list out the things I experienced growing up and always thought was normal until my coworkers and friends pointed out it really wasn't:

- I was strongly influenced to not have friends and always put my family before anyone.

- Even until I was 22 years old I was not to be trusted to have friends over the house without an adult or my brother whom was allowed to have friends over anytime he pleased since he was 18

- My brother (5 years older than me) got to decide whether I can go out or must stay home regardless if there was a reason or not.

- My brother can also tell me I can't have any friends over even when I was 21 years old and still lived with me and my parents.

- My brother would enforce me as a child to ""pat-down"" all my friends who came over to the apartment we lived in to ensure nobody stole anything. This rule did not apply to my brother's friends.

- My mother has threatened to kill herself  and me multiple times when I was a child growing up. Sometimes she would take a meat cleaver to her neck and scream at me and my brother that shes going to cut her head off and kill herself because of us. And sometimes -

- My mother would swerve into the wrong side of the road towards oncoming traffic when we were bad, threatening to kill us and herself.

- When my brother was old enough to drive and he would also swerve into oncoming traffic if I he was mad at me or if we got into a disagreement.

- Ironically, when I was old enough to drive, I also did the same thing to a friend who is still considered one of my closest friend to this day. He pissed me off and I thought threatening his life would help me win the argument.

- I also remember when I was very young my mom told me not to go outside because I had some kind of allergy or Asthma, I did not listen and helped my grandma with her yard because she was going to pay me 20$. I told her and she put her hands around my neck shook my neck and told me she was going to kill me, very angrily and very convincing at least at the time to me.

- More less severe things is that my brother acted like he owned me, like if I wanted to go out and my mother said I could and my brother said I can't he would threaten to take away my games.

- whenever he disallowed me to do things he would sometimes include statements like ""not in my house"" this fucking bitch didn't own shit. He's had three cars handed to him and gave me shit and tried to claim he bought one of the my mom bought him brand new, which I confronted my mom about. 

- I believe my step-dad might have caught on to my brother's bullshit and convinced my mom and him that it was time for him to move out.

Anyways , I literally just started having angry flashbacks just now while writing the last three. I think I have more of a grudge towards my brother than my mother. I'll stop here before I go on forever but thank you for those who read this far, I honestly feel that I needed this more to vent than to really seek an answer.";0

# Family Makeup

(If you want to get to the question at hand without my life story, just skip to the heading ""The Dilemma"")

I am from a large family. Middle child of 7.

I never really knew my father (for the best, really. I have zero desire to know him), because he was sent to prison (rightfully so) when I was very young. Before I can remember, honestly. But my brother and I were his sons. My parents had 3 other children before us, my 3 older half-siblings (I rarely call them half-siblings, only for clarity sake when detailing family histories). This story really doesn't include my older half-siblings for the most part, only briefly. They are 10, 9, and 4 years older than me.

When I was 2 or 3, my mother met and married a new man, we will call him Harry (his name was not Harry). And they had a daughter together, my younger half-sister. So, my younger brother, younger sister, and I were all born within 3.5 years of each other, my younger half-sister being 3.5 years younger than me.  My father also had another daughter when I was 13. So, my siblings and I range in birth years from 1975 to 2003.

But really, this story focuses on me, my younger full-brother (11 months younger than me), my younger half-sister (3.5 years younger than me), my mother, and my step-father.

# The Wretched Brothers (TW: Physical and Verbal/Emotional Abuse)

So, my step-father would abuse my brother and me, a lot. Every night. He was an alcoholic, and would often beat my brother and me, along with more severe physical abuse (&gt;!burning us with cigarettes and coffee irons, pushing us down the stairs, locking us in the basement, forcing us to sleep on tiles floors underneath a pool table.... so much. We would have bruises and burns that we had to hide from school officials. !&lt;). Not only did he physically abuse my brother and me, he also abused our mother in similar ways. The infraction could be as mundane as ... well nothing. Sometimes, I am convinced he just did these things because he enjoyed to see us suffer. Honestly. Because we would do absolutely nothing, but get punished for it. Spilled milk? Punished. Breathed too loudly? Punished. Sat in the corner minding our own business? Punished. And by ""punished,"" I mean the abuse that I have hidden under spoiler tags.

But, though the physical abuse was intense, the emotional/verbal abuse was much, much worse. A bruise can heal, but the things he said to us affected our whole lives. This was much more than just being overly critical or saying hurtful things now-and-then. This was constant. He would call us the worse things imaginable. He refused to let us go anywhere because he said that we were thieves (we weren't). Every night, he would angrily tell us how worthless we were, calling us the most vile names. We were locked in the basement when company was over because we would ""embarrass him.""

Now, looking back to when I was a kid, from what I remember, we were pretty much like every other child (I had some bizarre idiosyncrasies, but my brother was completely normal, honestly). And asking people who knew us from that time, we were regarded as pretty delightful children, who weren't prone to mischief more so than any other child. Actually, we were described as timid and respectful.

Basically, the abuse did not match our behavior. And even if we were the terrifically unruly children that he said we were, we didn't deserve *that.*

Alongside the physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, there was also neglect. We didn't have beds, and were forced to sleep on the tile floor under the pool table. We rarely got the clothes we needed, having to wear clothes that we obviously had outgrew. And, for a time, we were homeless and couldn't get food. Much of this was due to abject poverty, but even when we weren't in dire straits, we were still not afforded the necessities. This also falls somewhat on my mother, but that is unfair to blame her for any of this, which I will expound upon later.

# The Golden Child

I suspect you saw this coming. My brother and I were abused and neglected, and my younger half-sister could do no wrong. Now, of course, she was his daughter. And in many ways, she was raised as if she was an only child. While my brother, my mother, and I were relegated to the basement floor, my half-sister lived a life of privilege upstairs. She got all the newest clothes. She had her own room with a bed. She got anything she ever wanted. And, growing up in a household like this, I assumed this is just how life was. Boys were treated like trash, and girls were treated like royalty. It made sense at the time, I suppose (mind you, I was under 12).

I cannot tell you how many times my brother and I would be punished for something my sister did. We would *watch* our sister do something terrible, then blame it on us, and we would get punished. Then our mother/step-father would praise her for being brave enough to tell! It was infuriating!!! No matter how much my brother and I protested and told the truth, no one believed us. My sister laughs about this to this day.

Now, looking back she too was being abused, just in a different way. The favorite(s) is(are) being abused just as much as the scapegoat(s). It is just a different dynamic.

To illustrate how different our lives were, my older half-sister on my father's side would call to talk to my brother and me. We weren't allowed to talk to her, but my younger half-sister would have full conversation with her. I didn't find this out until I was an adult, and my older half-sister told me. No one told us that my older half-sister called us ever. But, every time she called, she got to speak with my younger half-sister. Mind you, they are not related in any way (I suppose they share two half-brothers).

# The Nightmare Ends

From the time I was 3, until the time I was 12, this was my life (with a small respite when my mother finally got fed up with it all and left him for a few months). Nothing I did was good enough (a trait that has followed me throughout life). Daily being abused. Watching our sister live an entirely different life. And having nothing to compare it to, because to us, this was how things *are.* We didn't know it wasn't normal to be treated like this. It wasn't until maybe high school that I realized, ""Wow, people didn't live like this!"" But, it finally ended one day in October when I was 12.

Harry died unexpectedly. I shed not a single tear. I was sad for my sister. I was somewhat sad for my mother. I was sad for Harry's parents. But, in almost all ways, I was relieved and happy he was dead. So was my brother. And I suspect, my mother was at least relieved he would no longer torture any of us.

My sister was 8 years old at the time.

# My Dear Mother

I love my mother. I feel like she did the best with what she had. She loved each of us intensely. She had an infectious laugh, and a caring spirit. She was a joy to be around. Most of the time.

Counterintuitively, my most horrific memories have to do with my mother. You see, she was schizophrenic, and because of that, every single one of us children went through some awful experiences.

Now, when she was not experiencing a psychotic episode, she was the loving, amazing woman we all adored. But during those true psychotic episodes (of which she had no control over, having breakthrough episodes even on her medication), I and my siblings experienced some of the most traumatic experiences of our lives. Later in life, while I was an adult, so more prepared to cope with the trauma, my mother once blew up her oxygen tank, setting fire to her assisted living facility. Throughout the years, she had numerous episodes.

This is why I rarely blame my mother for not doing enough to protect us and herself. She was scared herself. Harry, on more than one occasion, &gt;!threatened to kill her and my brother and me. My mother would tell us that she would often wake up with Harry strangling her in the middle of the night. Plus, he was a hunter, and kept her gunpoint - metaphorically.!&lt; Add this with her underlying mental illness, and it is very difficult to assign any blame to my mother. She couldn't work, and at the time, she couldn't get on disability either. The one time she did find the courage to leave Harry, we ended up starving, freezing, and homeless. And then Harry came to stay with us while homeless, before eventually moving us to his car, then his parent's motorhome, and then finally.. the basement.

Since my mother was in a vulnerable position (her mental health and having no income due to disability), it just seems like predatory men found her, and made her life (and her children's lives) miserable.

In my head, yes, the experiences were traumatic, but in the same way a hurricane or earthquake is traumatic. Who do you blame?

# The Aftermath

So, now it is well over 20 years since Harry died. My mother passed in 2013 due to lung cancer/COPD. I have spent years in therapy, trying to heal. Even tried to be a therapist myself (big mistake. Trigger. Trigger. Trigger. HOSPITAL!). I have lived with daily SI since probably the time I was 9, and have had nearly 20 psych hospitalizations throughout the last 20 years. I am living knowing that I survived quite an ordeal.

But, my brother did not survive Harry's abuse. He died by suicide when he was 17. Clearly, Harry wasn't the only trauma that we had experienced. Often times when my mother would have a psychotic episode, my brother and I would be shuffled in and out of foster care. Sometimes together, sometimes apart. One time we were put in juvenile detention because we were ""too old for foster care."" We were 13 and 14. We had different privileges than everyone else because we weren't there for ""delinquency,"" which actually made us more of targets (we got treated differently by staff, so the other boys would beat us, and one &gt;!sexually assaulted us.!&lt;

I got emancipated when I was 16. Had my own apartment. Went into the Army. Became an Army nurse. And here's the thing - basic training was *fun.* It was a breeze compared to what I had experienced earlier in life. Got out of the Army, went to college. Made a life as best as I could.

But even now, one thing still bugs me.

# The Dilemma

So, now whenever I bring up Harry around my half-sister, she gets angry. She has said that I am exaggerating what happened, and that it wasn't that bad. I love my sister, and we are actually very close, but this is a real kicker.

She doesn't even acknowledge that her father did anything wrong. Which makes me question my own experiences. But it isn't like I am the only one saying these terrible things about her father. My mother confirmed what happened. My older siblings confirmed what happened. Even one of my half-sister's *cousins* confirmed what happened.

Which was oddly satisfying when I learned that her cousin confirmed the abuse. I was very active in church, and so during testimony, I would sometimes detail some of the experiences I had with Harry. I had a church mentor/friend who thought I was exaggerating, because to her, it sounded so outrageous, it must not have happened.

Well, I started working for this church mentor/friend, and a few years later, we bring in a new employee. Without my permission, my boss/mentor/friend starts divulging my personal history to this new employee (yes, I realize how inappropriate this is). During the conversation the new employee thought it was weird how similar it was to the story of her aunt's and uncle's family house. Turns out, my half-sister is the employee's cousin once removed (my step-father is her cousin). She then goes on to inform my boss/mentor/friend how terrible the situation actually was, and that I might even have been minimizing what happened, definitely not exaggerating. This was a cousin who I was not even allowed to see because it would ""embarrass"" my step-father. Any time she would come to visit, we were locked in the basement.

How can my half-sister not acknowledge this? At least say something like ""I know my father was a complicated man, I still love him, but I abhor what he did to my two brothers."" Or... anything? To her, ""Harry did nothing wrong, and the things he did do, y'all deserved it. And actually, it was our *mom* who messed us all up, not my dad.""

It is hurtful and infuriating. To the point that we cannot talk about her dad at all.

Anyone else experience this kind of gaslighting?";0
105;105;796_ptsd;"Does anybody else struggle with not remembering their trauma? I have very few conscious memories of my earliest childhood traumas, but my _body_ remembers it. I remember smells, textures, sensations, but few images, no narrative, no order of events. The myriad evidence that anything bad happened is circumstantial, but I _do_ remember enough to know I was violated, and I am definitely trigger-able. It’s almost irrelevant whether or not the trauma occurred, because regardless of what events transpired, I am left with all the trappings of PTSD.

Why, then, am I so consumed and guilt-riddled by my lack of specific memory? Why do I feel like I’m a terrible human being for suspecting the worst of my caregiver? Like even if it _did_ happen, it absolutely _must_ have been my fault for “misunderstanding” things? Like if only I knew _for sure_, why, then... Then I could argue to myself why my feelings are _differently_ illegitimate, and it’s all still my fault, with the added bonus of perpetual nightmare fuel?... I do NOT want to remember it, but at the same time, it feels invalid if I don’t.

I know there are many flavors of misery to be had with this illness, but if there’s anybody out there in a similar boat, if you have found a way to cope with crippling guilt and shame caused by absent memories, please share what has helped you. I would love to feel a little less alone.

I avoid thinking about them, and I avoid thinking about them. And yet, I can feel they are there in my “soul”.

Not the details, just the broad strokes. I talked to old veteran buddies who were there with me. I even called to start up the therapy. But every time I talked about it, I would feel so much worse. Not only did I feel truly terrified and upset about what happened for the first time ever,  but I would feel such shame and embarrassment about everything about what I did, about not being strong enough to talk about it without having a total emotional melt-down, shame about having an emotional melt-down in front of people. And I would think to myself “is this emotional reaction even appropriate? After all when the things actually happened, my thoughts and emotions were pretty much “I wonder what’s for dinner” and then I feel guilty about being some apparent psychopath who didn’t feel anything as people were killed around him, some of them friends. All of this shit didn’t feel good to air. Instead I just felt awful afterwords in a million different ways. 

I started to “come out” then “noped” everything back into the closet. Then I was even ashamed of myself chickening out of actually dealing with it. Life is ok for me with this locked up in my mind. Not great, but ok. I have depression but I am managing ok in spite of it. I am successful in life generally, but i feel like airing this shit could literally ruin my life.";1

I’ve been in therapy for a little over a month now and was finally told that I have PTSD from the sexual abuse I dealt with when I was a child. No one in my family knows about what I’ve been through—my mom is actually still married to the man who abused me. I have told my current boyfriend about it as well as a few friends over the years but it has always been a secret. 

I perseverate on it daily and it has had an effect on every aspect of my life. I’m happy I’m making progress in addressing it in therapy and working on healing.

However, I want to tell my brother and maybe my sister about it more than anything. My brother (27M) lives on his own and is fairly independent. However, like everyone else in my life, loves and respects my abuser (he is extremely charismatic). My sister (21F) is my abuser’s daughter (we share the same mom though) and I often wonder if she was subjected to the same abuse I went through. She deals with anxiety but seems to have a good relationship with him so I’m really unsure. She also still lives at home so I don’t want to put her in danger either.

Last year in a similar capacity a hemp(cbd) company was started and the hemp(cbd) products were added at the dispensary. We have several patients that love the hemp but have also found most medical patients with prescriptions for mj don’t go through the red tape and expenses involved to come to the dispensary to get their hemp since it’s available at several locations nearby without the patient prescription necessary.

I’m simply wondering at this point if there would be any interested in participating?
We are about two weeks from rolling out the program which will require submitting a request to participate form as well as filling out a brief survey. There’s no specific disqualifications or commitments. It is a long term study and participants will have access to hemp at or near cost in return for participating. Organic hemp flower at about 1$ a gram as an example. You are more then welcome to join the study and use which ever hemp(cbd) you have found that works.

I was married for five to a man who was emotionally abusive, and I caught him cheating on me three different times, with men and women, using the internet. Each time it happened it was like hell breaking loose inside of me. Once was bad enough, then two more times on top of it. The most damning part was he pretended to care about our family and about me and presented this image to the world as the greatest guy and everyone loved him but behind my back and everyone’s back he did these horrible things like he was two people. I once caught him on social media impersonating a high school girl trying to get pictures but he destroyed the evidence before I could call the police. 

Now I am in a relationship with a man who is actually a good man but it’s like I can’t shut this part of my brain off that associates social media, technology, things of this nature, where my boyfriend is concerned, as perceived threats. When I don’t manage myself manually through the use of CBT and DBT from therapy, my brain is on autopilot in hypervigilance....anything associated with social media (which is how I found him three times) it’s like at certain times usually when I’m ill or tired or stressed it’s like I feel this vein of anxiety open up in me and out it comes...all the feelings that I felt that night, the other night, the night after, of the horror and despair of seeing him doing awful things behind my back. And I have to scan and stalk and research deeply into my boyfriend’s social media to try to quiet this desperation that’s roaring inside of me to find anything. It’s like I wish I could say I did it to self-sooth but the truth is really I do it to self-protect. If I go searching for it and find it, then it won’t hurt as bad. If I mistrust ahead of time and I make a discovery then I beat the terror and despair. The vein of anxiety only gets worse. And suddenly I see things that aren’t even there. A liked photo of a female must represent....so much. And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb. And he is there just reminding me, gently... this isn’t happening right now. This is your past, this isn’t our present. I’ve never lied to you. I’ve always kept my promises to you. I love you. 

And it is true. I’m so ashamed of what my brain does when a trigger happens. The feelings emotional and physical all come back. It’s like I’m in a nightmare but I’m awake. I’m fighting ghosts of the past and metaphorically swinging at the man who loves me, trying to hit my ex husband (metaphorically). 

I’ve been working on this, been using my skills, and I’m not as reactive as I used to be. I can know what is and isn’t real like I can step out of the experience.  I can quietly articulate what I’m feeling. I can peacefully communicate my way through it with my boyfriend.

But the behavior of feeling the trigger, feeling the vein open, and feeling like I did the nights I first saw something suspicious and then going right into the compulsive activities of searching, searching, searching, searching, like I did after all the times, until in the past I found what would destroy me three times over and over and in the present where I’m finding nothing but yet making something out of it anyway, as if I’m on autopilot as if I’m awake in a nightmare as if  I’m reliving it all over again, and yet as if my brain is doing all this so I can “conquer” this thing.

Flash Forward this week and we come back from vacation, everything is good until we good home and she SCREAMs at me for texting her during game of thrones (like manic like) then she takes me off her instagram bio and said she wants to talk, I ended up telling her today I am done with everything and she is a piece of shit human being.

Should someone say they are a survivor of the attacks, our hearts soften for them. Anyone who made fun of a survivor would be labeled anything from asshole to pure evil.

1057;1057;1789_ptsd;"Everything but PTSD Up until my diagnosis this year, I had no idea why I was the way I was. There exists only four years of my 30 year life not touched by trauma. 

A list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.

Extreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn’t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.


Fainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I’m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children’s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)


Insomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn’t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn’t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven’t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. 


Vivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it’s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. 


Social Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)


Heart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn’t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)


Depression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn’t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I’m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn’t make me sad or upset, it’s not like I wanted those things because I don’t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn’t close to my dad but wasn’t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn’t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn’t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)


Irregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I’m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)


Concentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) 


A few other things I experienced but I don’t feel like going into:
Eating disorders
Alcohol and drug abuse 
Promiscuity 


All of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I’m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. 


Just now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns.";1
110;110;1394_ptsd;"Everything is a Trigger Today I woke up today after a night full of nightmares. I woke up exhausted because even though I slept for 10 hours, it felt like I only slept for 2 hours. My nightmares were all my fears and the reasons I have PTSD. So you can imagine that my anxiety was through the roof and was extremely agitated by the slightest things. 
I tried to explain this to my S/O in hopes that he would cut me some slack with his jokes. The reason I say this is because his “jokes” are to push my buttons, buttons that piss me off or scare me. 
Throughout the day I tried to just be quiet and to just get through this day, but of course my S/O wouldn’t have that. 
So finally, when I started to feel a little better we began to watch a movie. Everything was fine and we were enjoying it. Until he gasped and said “babe” and gave me a serious look. Obviously a million thought went through my head and my anxiety shot through the roof in a split of a second. Then he says “the remote fell behind the couch.” 
So that was it. That was the moment when I couldn’t handle it anymore and flew off my rockers. I cursed him like I’ve never done before. Then he told me to go to the bedroom. We were quiet for a few second then I got up and went into the bedroom and laid down. He came in and all he said was to never talk to him like that again. I said I’m sorry and he turned off the light and left me alone in the bedroom. 
I don’t feel sorry. I don’t exactly know how I feel. It’s a mixture between anger, hating myself, suicidal thoughts, sadness and hopelessness. 
I don’t know if what I said was that wrong given the circumstances. ";0
357;357;939_ptsd;"Everything keeps hitting me all at once Let me start this by saying I have PTSD. Everything hits me a bit harder than most people so if you think this is nothing, it may be for you but for me it's hell.

Let's start with last week. I contacted Amazon over a pretty simple request. I'm on disability and didn't receive my cheque for December. I've been scraping by for that month and this by dumpster diving and panhandling. Merry Christmas to me I guess. At any rate, I contacted Amazon customer service with an off hand request. I had gotten a Prime trial and asked them if they could extend it for a month for free. I explained the situation. Didn't expect anything from it at all, but the reaction I got was weird. The person I was chatting to on their website started asking for order numbers. I said nevermind and ended the chat. 13 hours later he emails me to say he didn't understand what I was talking about and said to contact again. So I did. Weirdly, the second person was like ""No problem, done. Go enjoy The Grand Tour!"" So I tried to get on Prime and it didn't work. Figured I'd let it be for a couple days. 

While waiting, my roommate comes back. He left in November to go to India for the holidays. I forgot how much noise he made. He's on the phone at all hours of the day and night. He often puts the other person on speaker phone and will yell his responses. I can't sleep. I mean I can't afford my medication to sleep properly anyway, but this asshole is so fucking loud that I couldn't sleep if I did have the meds. I've gotten maybe 2-3 hours sleep since he returned last week. I turned the music on once at 10AM and he had the nerve to tell me to turn it down. That pissed me off even more. 

While all this is going on, I'm waiting for the government to tell me what happened to my disability cheque. They keep saying they're doing investigations and will have another sent out as soon as it's done, but that does fucking nothing for me. We don't have food stamps here so I can't go get that. Food bank is miles away and my knees are fucked, so getting there is hell to begin with and coming back takes multiple hours. Even if I did get there, I don't have a current statement from the government with my address on it because they didn't send the goddamned cheque. 

So I go back to Amazon. Prime still isn't working. So Customer Service tells me it's just a glitch and they'll reach out to me in 12 hours. They do. 12 hours later they say I never had prime to begin with. So I contact customer service AGAIN. This time I get someone who calls me darling every 3 seconds despite me asking repeatedly for her to knock it off. She says that they did give me an extension on the prime but it was an extension of nothing because the prime was already over. She then hangs up on me. So I say fuck it and tweet Amazon. They respond and ask what's wrong. I explain. At this point I don't care about the free prime. I had no right to it anyway, I always thought it was a longshot, but being told a half dozen different things is just bizarre and confusing. They then don't respond for a day. So I say ""Uh hello?"" And another amazon rep comes on twitter to ask what's wrong. I explain again. No response. Today, 4 days later, I say that it's the worst service I've received. Amazon immediately jumps on and gives me a link to contact. I do and don't even get a chance to explain. The dude just says another department will reach out to me.

Then I turn to Canada Post and ask why the hell I didn't get stuff delivered. They shrug and say ""We deliver until 8PM."" I'm checking the mail continuously. We have no mail and no one else has gotten mail in the neighborhood. We live next door to a Canada Post and have never had this problem before. Maybe it's the weather? No. People across the road got their mail. Just that we didn't. So no cheque for me today despite being told I'd get it today. That means no eating today, no meds today, no paying bills today. Sitting in the dark crying all night. 

Like I said it in't much. But this is overwhelming to all hell to me and I'm freaking the fuck out. I want to beat the shit out of my roommate because he won't shut the fuck up, I want to scream my goddamn head off at Amazon because they won't give me a straight fucking answer. I want to lose my shit at the government because they lost my cheque and i've been without any money since the start of December. 

To top it all off, a storm kicked up at 3PM and I can't go dumpster diving for any food. Tomorrow it's going to be worse and colder so I won't be able to go dumpster diving then either AND the mail likely won't show up again. 

I just fucking want this all to stop. everythnig. I can't get a breather. Meds I'm on barely work to begin with so when this shit happens I just feel lost and terrified and suicidal to all hell. I'm so... idk. overwhelmed. overloaded. Just something. ";0
566;566;248_ptsd;"Everything triggers flashbacks, crying every day I’m 23 years old, and last year in April my 15 year old brother hung himself in his closet. 
We were best friends, partners in crime. We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. 
I was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn’t feel like I was getting better. 
I was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn’t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. 
I saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I’m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. 
I’ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. 
My medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. 
It’s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can’t handle my grief, I can’t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It’s absolutely horrible. 
I’m a hairdresser and I’ll have clients say certain words to me like “hang” “closet” “died/death” “brother” or make jokes about suicide even though it’s completely out of context I’ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It’s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don’t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. 
I hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can’t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. 
It is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I’m not ready to explain to the people around me what I’m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. 
It’s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don’t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. 

I can’t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I’m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn’t like me. Advance on getting over that fear would be so appreciated because I KNOW I need some serious therapy right now and my family tells me all the time. Does anyone have any good skills in these areas? Please help me. I’m suffering and I know damn well I can’t go through the rest of my life like this. 

TLDR — My baby brother committed suicide last year, and I ended up developing PTSD from it; I have been having extreme flashbacks and my therapist stopped treating me due to my diagnosis. I really need advice on coping skills for flashbacks &amp; how to be vulnerable to another professional.";1
318;318;1363_ptsd;"Everytime I close my eyes On November 4, I saw a drunk homeless woman get hit by a car, twice. The first time was from far away, the second time was when i was within a few feet of her. If I had been a few inches closer i would have gotten hit too.

I could further describe, but for the sake of my triggers and for others I won’t get into it. I’ve been going to therapy and I was diagnosed with acute PTSD- meaning my symptoms are short term.

lm 18 years old. I pulled over to save this woman. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have nightmares, I wouldn’t have lost any sleep, I wouldn’t have this loss of motivation and the awful flashbacks, anxiety and guilt. I wouldn’t have nearly failed my psychology and forensics classes because of how triggering they were. 

Every time I close my eyes I can go back there and relive everything.

387;387;665_ptsd;"existing trauma as a child+internet shock sites: did i re-traumatize myself? hey, so i'd like to keep this short and sweet initially, because i'm mainly curious if anyone else had a similar experience.

i was molested by my father as an adolescent. my memory is pretty murky so i can only approximate my age--i think i was 10-13. around that same time i ending up perusing encyclopedia dramatica and similar pages a lot, looking at content that would be inappropriate for any person ever, let alone a young, hurting, isolated child. i've seen about every shock image from the 2005-2010 internet era. i've read awful stories about rape, murder, pedophilia, et cetera. i've seen awful pornography--about anything you can imagine, just barely legal. i've seen videos of people dying. and most of this i saw before high school. 

i've not told anyone about this. one of my good friends in high school was also into this stuff, but we're no longer close and i don't know if he similarly feels traumatized now or not. i am going to speak to my therapist about it next time we meet. i've only really acknowledged it as a problem to myself lately, but now that it's reared its head the emotional turmoil is very painful to bear. i am not comfortable telling my friends--only one of them even knows i was molested, and that she only knows because we were drunk and she told me she was as well. i feel sad, disgusted, ashamed, angry. i wish i could go back to my younger self and do what none of the adults that were supposed to help did--let me know that i was and am not a freak, or a monster, or a predator.

i still struggle with that now. despite not having seen this stuff for close to a decade, i still see those images sometimes when i close my eyes. i sought them out at the time, so i also feel foolish for retroactively being traumatized. most victims don't willingly waltz into the arms of trauma, but i did, countless times over several years. it's affected my sex life (or lack thereof), my self-confidence (i've seen how nasty people can be on the internet, and i always knew that i was only a hair's breadth away from being targeted myself), my ability to connect with others, blah blah.

813;813;1517_ptsd;"Experience reporting sexual abuse? Is it worth it? (X-post from /r/rapecounseling) I was raped repeatedly by a family member over the course of about 4 years as a child. In my state there is no statute of limitations on reporting and after years and years of trauma counseling I finally feel the urge to report what happened and press charges. Do any of you have experience with this? What are the first steps? Is it even worth the trouble? Will I have to see him again? 

I’m a little torn because as much as I want justice for what happened to me I definitely don’t want to re-traumatize myself by reliving everything in front of strangers  just to have my rapist get off.

782;782;1664_ptsd;"Experiencing flashbacks and dissociation? Hi, my name is Liz and I'm a 30 year old woman with a lot of past trauma. Specifically, most of the trauma happened when I was a child living with parents who were abusive to one another and myself. I seem to be having flashbacks to things that have happened in my current relationship though. My partner likes to drink and I do not. I have no problem with anyone drinking around me, it's just that I don't find pleasure in it myself. He has acted in very scary and mean ways while drinking, and even though it has been over a year since he has done anything like this, I seem to be having issues. I lay in bed and sometimes have memories (that prior I didn't remember, or hadn't thought of in a long time) and they feel real. For example: he screamed in my face one time, and I had a memory of it the other night. I felt his voice causing my whole body to shake and rattle. I felt my life being possibly threatened. It took quite some time to shake the residual feelings and go to sleep. 

After experiencing the flashbacks, or experiencing something he has done, I tend to dissociate. At least I think it's dissociation. I actually welcome it and LIKE the feeling. I just kind of go away. I can't see what's in front of me or hear what people say. I go on autopilot or just stare into nothingness. It almost feels like maybe I'm going cross-eyed, lol. But no one has confirmed this for me. Although, as a child, my teachers would accuse me of ""daydreaming"" all the time. I would try to explain to my mom that I wasn't ""thinking"" of anything. I was just in a daze. She said, well whatever it is, just cut it out, lol. 

I like this feeling of being numb or calm and unaware. Is that unusual? Are these signs of PTSD? I really am not sure and just looking for some answers and possibly some people out there who are going through the same.  Most of the time I hear people describe dissociation as an unwanted or unpleasant thing. So, I'm a little confused as to why I welcome the sensation. (Most of the time, unless I'm trying to do something important)

I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I hope you are doing well during these difficult times. Much love to you all ❤❤❤";1
969;969;1587_ptsd;"Facial tics and stuttering after PTSD I’m wondering if someone can put a name to this, or at least relate? I have some weird tics that seem to come on strong for weeks at s time, then go away, then come back. I know they’re anxiety related, but it seems neurological too.

I have a few old surgery scars, and the other day I just became hyper aware of them, as if they were a seam on my clothing! I’ve got a blinking tic, where I’ve got to just blink hard and frequently, and I’ve been clenching my jaw and grinding my teeth (I’m awake and aware of the teeth grinding too, it isn’t something I do in my sleep). Even my speech patterns change when I’m put on the spot. Sometimes I’ll try to say two words at once or begin stuttering if I feel self conscious. ALL of these tics are new as of the last few years (I’m a 27 year old woman, these all seemed to come with the PTSD).

I can list other weird sensitivities too, but those are the biggest ones. I have major decision anxiety and the last few days I’ve been fairly isolated and doing a lot of budgeting and planning.  I get so embarrassed by the blinking tic because it is very noticeable. I am otherwise functional and feel like I’m on the other side of my PTSD. Is there anything I can do to stop this?";0

I used to have this crippling fear around men after that, like my limbs would feel cut by fear and I avoided them. Thanks to therapy, I no longer feel like that, however, a part of it shows up if I find someone sexually attractive.
Has anyone dealt with this? I would like to overcome it, but I get scared and just act totally disinterested and aloof.";1
817;817;2011_ptsd;"Feel like I started my life again today. Over the past 2 years, I've been suffering from what at times felt time paralyzing ptsd that I couldn't escape. I'm in Mountain Rescue, and over the past two years I've had missions with nothing but fatalities. The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury. None the less, it was traumatic and recently I started getting anxious and irritable.

Today I got a mission call out for a missing 7 year old girl who went missing at their families camping vacation last night. Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out ""fuck yes"" after I heard on the radio ""we've made contact!"". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. 

I'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help. However in the end, I feel like I was given a gift, and a chance to start over and keep my passion for helping others going. I know that many of you on here are in a rut or hole and feel like you cant get out, but please, don't give up. You never know when you might get your chance to rebuild like I did today. I can't say that tomorrow I will be fixed and everything will be better, but I know that today was a milestone, and my path has changed for the better. I hope that you too get that chance to improve your path soon.

Love you all and stay strong.";0
691;691;1418_ptsd;"Feeling Alone I have never posted on reddit before, but I wanted to reach out because some of your posts really have helped me feel (not better or worse, just feel) today. I'm not certain if I should trigger warn so I'm adding NSFW in case.

In February 2019 my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD due to a sexually abusive, manipulative, compulsive liar relationship I was in in 2010. It was short, but very intense and I did not go to therapy properly for it til this past November. (2018) 2018 I was in a serious relationship for the first time since that abusive relationship and so some of the things that trigger me would not have come up until then because they are related to being in an intimate relationship. 

This relationship was so good and I was so excited because I felt like I learned that I could love and trust. Then for some reason, it started to become rocky and this is when my episodes really ramped up. I did not truly understand that I was having flashbacks until after it was all over but essentially this SO told me that ""whatever I was doing"" to address my PTSD wasn't working and that I had ""lost the ability"" to control my emotions and I was not as resilient as I used to be. I would get so mad and upset and irrational and he would too. After my worst flashback he did not speak to me for 2 weeks - because he needed space. (I don't blame him, but it was excruciating and I felt so much shame because I was reeling from the trigger) After the 2 weeks he broke up with me.

This all cut me to my core. Now, 7 months later, I'm finally coming out of the haze of sadness from that relationship ending. I'm in grad school for Social Work, I have my own apartment, I have two jobs and an internship. I'm doing what I wanted to do!! But I still am feeling so dejected and also really struggling to make friends because I'm nearly 30 and it's hard to make new friends but also I'm realizing, because I'm afraid to get close to people in case I have a trigger moment and they can't take it. 

I don't know if anyone has any thoughts but I just feel really small and alone and I have appreciated reading your posts so I thought I would reach out.

Peace and comfort to you. &lt;3";1

628;628;1055_ptsd;Feeling Numb 8 months ago I experienced a traumatic incident between me and one of my closest friends. I don’t want to elaborate too much, but my friend had gotten really drunk and had what we believed to be a psychotic episode and physically attacked me. Since this incident, he has been attending therapy and I have as well. But although I’ve discussed it a couple times with my therapist...I’m not sure I’m really past what happened. I thought that maybe I was over it after talking about it several times, but I don’t really know how to treat this. I haven’t been diagnosed with PTSD and I don’t have reoccurring flashbacks besides a few small instances. But currently, due to other issues in our friendship, I feel less and less inclined to be around him or reach out to him. I don’t want to end our friendship but at the same time, I don’t mentally have the energy to deal with him. I just feel kinda blah about my relationship with him and I don’t know if I’m really “over” what happened, or just continuing to push it behind me.;1

464;464;1046_ptsd;"Finally getting help I had some childhood trauma.  And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   

I injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  

Well the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  

Luckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. 

I looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) 

 When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  

I went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a ""cookie cutter"" plan.

They explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. 

After going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  

They truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  

They also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    

With their help I have been clean 3.5 months.

It is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. 

So today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.

For the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future.... And it gets brighter every day!!!

We talked a lot about the child abuse and a little about all the other bad stuff that's happened to me. I guess being abused is the worst thing that happened to me, that's why I have PTSD after all. But I've also had many many years of a lot of little things adding up. She wants to do EMDR on me the day after tomorrow! She's had a lot of success with it. Has anyone else tried it? Did it work? If not, why do you think it didn't work? Am I going to suddenly remember something and have a nervous breakdown? Am I going to suddenly blab some deep dark secret? Will EMDR help with my anxiety too? In my head I'm imagining it to be this rapid fire hypnosis thing where you just start yelling out bad things super fast. What's it actually like?

798;798;2619_ptsd;"Finally told my brothers that I dont want my mom's ashes or belongings and I WILL be throwing her crap out (not ashes, even though I kind of want to haha) So about 5 years ago (holy crap, 5?) My mom committed suicide. Do not pity her. She did this specifically to screw with me, that's how vindictive she was after years of physical and then more years after that of emotional and verbal abuse. I took it and did it proudly because it protected my little brother and I would do it again 50 times over. When my mom went absolutely insane a couple years before her death, I took care of everything, she was in jail, I visited her I would say every week except missing when I was too sick with migraines to drive or with bad roads. Anytime I missed I could expect a letter about how much she hated me. After she was divorced I stored all her things in the basement. I let her have unlimited access, she stole from me. She liked to torture me over suicide with multiple failed attempts and asking if I had her stepladder only to after me giving it to her have her text me about how she was about to kill herself, knowing I would be there because it was my duty. Her last day alive, she asked for access to her things, said that was fine but I was at work so it would probably have to wait for the weekend, she proceeded to tell me how awful a daughter I was, deserving of hell, how much she hated me etc. I told her (finally) to get over herself, she hung herself that night while I was searching for her. 


After, I thought I had to be the matriarch. I had to be strong for everyone, including my brother. So at 22 I planned my first funeral 7 days after my 22nd birthday and 7 days before Christmas. While everyone was shopping for gifts I was shopping for an appropriate turtle neck to cover signs of her death. I hated her more than I thought I could hate anyone and it hurt. It still hurts but 5 years later Im thankful I dont have an abuser anymore. Im working on being ok with being happy she is dead, that she doesnt deserve anything just for the title of ""mom"" and that I dont have to keep her crap or her ashes out of duty. I owe her nothing. 


You know what, tonight Im going to go get some of her favorite tequila, empty it any way I want, because I am not her and I dont hurt people when I drink and throw some ashes in there. Maybe they will go in the dumpster, maybe not but she deserves to spend the rest of eternity with the thing she loved most.";1

121;121;375_ptsd;"First flashback in awhile today This is my first post here. My back story is thst in 2015 I fell during a free solo rock climb in the Ozark Mountains. I fell from approximately 50 ft and was kept alive by my two best friends until I was loaded into a helicopter five hours later. I lost seven teeth, crushed the right side of my face and broke my left humerus. While it's not ideal, I've accepted this moment in my life and the results of it. In a roundabout way, it's lead to one of my best friends meeting his now-fiancee and put me on a positive direction in life as opposed to bouncing around from job to job.

Over the past couple of years I dealt with roughly one dream a week reliving the experience and waking up in a panic. For the past year I've been going to a rock climbing gym and the dreams have largely stopped. I still avoid ladders and other heights, but I'm comfortable on the rock wall. I'm not as daring as others there, and it really limits the difficulty of climbs I can complete because I don't put myself out there as much as I could to make the more difficult moves. Sometimes I fall, but it's generally expected. Or I jump off because I'm worn out. 

Today I had an unexpected fall. It was only from about 7ft, but my foot slipped, just like it did in my accident. I hit the ground awkwardly, but unhurt and didn't stop shaking for an hour. I was on the verge of tears as I left the gym and bought a pack of cigarettes (I've been on an ecig for a few months). To top it off, I had to go in for a work meeting where the manager tore into us for the general decline in standards that's occurred lately, which is a whole other story.

I don't know what to do. I'm still on edge, and I don't want to sleep because I know I'll have a dream where I fall, or I lose my teeth, or crush my face or something. I was doing so well, and I know it's just a bad day, but I'm terrified that this step back will have more of an impact. I just need someone who's been here before to tell me something that helps.";1
1028;1028;1669_ptsd;"First post, a bit shaken up Hey everyone, first time posting here. Diagnosed with PTSD 2 years ago. 

So last night around 1am, I was in bed getting ready to sleep and I heard keys jangling outside my door, and I  just assumed it was my neighbours. I live in private student accommodation, so we have 24 hour security, I generally feel very safe. But then, after hearing these keys, my door began to open and a security guard walked in. I jumped out of bed to speak with him, apparently he'd had a noise complaint, my TV was on but it wasn't loud enough to be heard from where the complaint was, so he apologised for disturbing me and left. After he was gone I just broke down, it scared me so much

This morning I found out he filed a report himself because he's new to the job, and had thought that my flat was one with a communal living space, ie. A flat he would be allowed to enter without knocking. He had no idea he was walking into a studio flat, essentially my bedroom.
I know that this guy made an honest mistake, I'm not upset about that. It just upset me so much to have someone walk into my space like that with no warning. I don't necessarily want to go into my PTSD diagnosis on this post, but I'm so shaken up by this event.
I really don't feel like being in my apartment at all, and I can't sleep because I feel like someone could just walk in. I'm so on edge and I'm so tired. I feel like I'm overreacting, but when I think about it I start shaking. I just don't feel like anyone understands, so I guess that's why I'm here, I wanted to get it off my chest to people who would understand.

335;335;1375_ptsd;"Found Pictures TW CSA *****TW sexual abuse*****

My father had an ongoing joke with himself to take lewd photos of my mom bending over (especially in swim suits/underwear/nude). This was explicitly sexual in nature. Last night we found some old photos, and one of them my mom stopped and said ""No.. that's you"" when I was 6. Lewd photos of me when I was 6. I was embarrassed so I went to put my son to bed. My mom ripped it up, and hasnt spoken to me about it. I've reached out to my husband and a friend and havent gotten response, and I'm just feeling... gross? Weird? Mad that she ripped it up so she doesnt have to think about it? Completely fucked over that everyone still wants to ignore me. 

3 or 4 years ago I went through all his old shit when my grandpa was selling our old house (he bought it 15 years ago from my dad) I found a note in the attic I wrote to him when I was maybe 8, and in it I mention him leaving his digital camera in my room (also some completely brain washed garbage about how he was right and asked him not to get mad). When I found this many gross fragmented memories rushed back into my mind. Even typing it makes me want to barf.

I've been out and honest about the sexual abuse by my father for years now, and it has completely torn my family apart (what was left of it after his years of crack and heroin addiction, dropping my sister and I off in another state and leaving, etc.). His side of the family call me a liar, try to bargain with my sister to see my son, berate me, spread ugly rumors about me... I just need some support I guess. I feel ugly and weird and ashamed. It's all so convoluted, confusing, and dirty that I hate looking at it. I hate remembering it. My memories are flawed, and yet they still come rushing back. And even then I think to myself... ""you are just over reacting. They are right about you""

I dont understand how there were 3 investigations against him for child molestation, and he cant apologize, or even address it. None of his family will either. They all just think he is the fucking best. And I'm dirt/ ""too sensitive"". Not to mention he openly admits to abusing other women including my mother.";0

187;187;1359_ptsd;"From ok to 0 in about 2 seconds I have a bunch of traumatic things that have happened to me while I was growing up (sexual abuse from family members, a long-term emotionally abusive relationship that has thankfully ended, and continually high pressure from my family to perform and has been very verbally abusive).

Previously I’ve been able to cope extremely well and sort of swept all of this under the rug. I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life’s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.

2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I’m seeing therapists but they haven’t put down a diagnosis yet) as I’m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I’ve had to stop work for the moment because I can’t cope.

I am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner’s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.

It’s father’s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven’t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it’s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don’t resolve any issues. And it’s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn’t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it’s taken a full toll on me.

The relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn’t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father’s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad’s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn’t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I’m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I’m terrified about my future and whether I’ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I’m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn’t that good to start with. My parents don’t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).

Right now I don’t feel safe and I don’t know what to do. This post didn’t really have a question - I am just massively triggered right now and want to vent my story anonymously. Thanks for reading.";1

so point of the post, i am trying to work through my trauma, because although it was hard for me to sleep as a child, now every time i start to go to sleep i have anxiety attack’s, which end up me pulling a 72 hour all nighter, sleeping for 16 hours then repeating that cycle. it seems like my trauma is affecting me in what i didn’t know it could, and i don’t know how to get through it. i don’t have insurance or money to get professional help. any tips? when i was younger i used to write and draw a lot, but my mom read my journals to my siblings, and now it’s really hard for me to write. i’m used to unhealthy coping mechanisms, and they seem to help more than the healthy ones, but i don’t want to continue to practice unhealthy coping mechanisms, and i really want help. another issue i seem to have is i don’t know who i am as a person, i don’t know if this has anything to do with me being dissociative, but it’s kinda scary, looking at myself and not recognizing anything. sometimes hold my own hand or stroke my arm to remind myself that i’m a person, i check my pulse to make sure i’m still alive because sometimes i don’t feel like i am. i feel numb. to everything and i really want to get better.";1
218;218;125_ptsd;"Girlfriend has a CPTSD diagnosis, but won’t acknowledge it or seek help I wasn’t sure where to post this so I apologise in advance if this isn’t the right place, but was hoping to get some advice from people a better understanding of this.


My girlfriend in the past has received a diagnosis for CPTSD after she experienced a sustained trauma as a child. She told me this early on in our relationship but it has never been mentioned since. 


But I feel that it is still affecting her everyday life in a very significant way. She doesn’t sleep from
nightmares, she’s hyper vigilant at all times, often descends into the deepest sadness for days at a time, says the most awful things about herself, she gets faint, sometimes disassociated or shuts down completely, and is so incredibly anxious most of the time. She just isn’t happy or enjoying her life at all. I have in the past gently suggested that she talk to a therapist, not with direct reference to C-PTSD but because she has told me she wants to die, or because of self harm, and this is met with quite a lot of hostility, saying that I thought she was crazy or just shifting my responsibility as a boyfriend on to a therapist, and it has almost lead to break-ups, so I haven’t suggested it in a while.


Another part of it is that within our relationship when I have made mistakes, nothing that I felt was too major - getting a bit cross, or being late to a meet up, it’s been world shattering for her, sent her spiralling down for days. She told me that sometimes she almost cries when she sees me because of the relief and safety it makes her feel. I was so touched that she felt that way but it also made me realise the responsibility I have, how careful I need to be to not make any slip-ups, and why she finds it so hard to forgive little things - if they’ve made her feel this awful I don’t really blame her. And it also made me realise that I actually never talk about how I’m feeling or if I’m upset, because of fear of upsetting her. There have been times when I’ve felt more like a carer than a boyfriend, I feel awful for saying that but it is how it’s felt. It is beginning to really affect me too and I don’t feel that that is sustainable in a relationship. 


I think that I need to encourage her to seek help,  but to be more upfront and talk about the C-PTSD and how I see her feeling, and to say that I don’t think things can continue with the way they currently are, with her whole world being dependent on me. Because I’ll inevitably slip up from time to time with little things as people do, and I don’t want her to have to feel so so sad when I do. But I do want to be with her, I love her and I want most for her to be happy. But I know that me suggesting this will not go down well. She doesn’t see the symptoms I mentioned as anything more than just situational - she doesn’t like work or she’s just tired. But while the situations have always changed the feelings haven’t. 


What I was hoping was if anyone with more experience of the condition might be able to make clearer is whether I am doing the right thing by suggesting getting help, and if so whether there are specific things I should avoid saying that could make the CPTSD worse, or if there’s a best way to go about it. I don’t want to bring up her old trauma with her anymore than I need to, I really don’t want to upset her with this, but I just don’t feel things are sustainable as they currently are. Thank you for any advice";0
1115;1115;1718_ptsd;"Girlfriend has PTSD and I make it worse, please help Hey everyone.

I've come here to prevent the end of our relationship...

Me: 24, Male, never met bio dad, upbringing was mildly traumatic

Her: 24, female, never met bio dad, mom abandoned her and traumatized her whole youth, she was physically hurt in a very very bad way, stepdad just disowned her this last year. 

When she screams, forgets important things, hits me and just goes manic I call her terrible names and say things that just surface more PTSD. 

At first, I thought I could help her and that it was just me being a jackass or something but as the relationship got worse I started abandoning her and now we no longer on talking terms for a grace period. 

We love each other very much and I have been in a few very solid relationships with none of this drama, but for some reason our love is so strong that people constantly are commenting on it and we are such a good team..when things are good. 

When she drinks its bad. 

Do I just give up or is their really a way to cope with this long-term with unelevated stress all the time?

Can she truly feel clarity and kill the poison flower growing inside of her?

Books, treatment, counseling ect.. anything would be of great use to me. 

Honestly, if we can manage this I will marry this girl so it means a lot to me.

I feel so physically sick and repulsed by the fact that nearly a year and over 5 court dates later, he's still unwilling to own up to what he's done to me. Just when I thought that I would never have to see him again (I transferred schools) I find out that I have to face him in court. The mere thought of this has lead me to feel like my lungs are collapsing and my entire body feels weak and defeated. Going to trial means re-experiencing my trauma all over again, except with him present to see just how much damage he did to me. I don't want him to see how much he has destroyed me and taken my piece of mind. I don't want him to get the sick satisfaction of seeing me cry but I know that going through a trial will bring me to tears.

1042;1042;1744_ptsd;"Got triggered by the news and can't stop being depressed since (sexual assault) Not sure this is the right place to talk about this, I've never really used reddit before. Hopefully someone can help or at least understand what I'm struggling with.
I've been through major trauma 8 years ago, as I was walking home from school a man attacked me. He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.
He eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.
What followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. 
I've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.
My family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). 
I couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.

I kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost. I couldn't hold memories for a while and if you ask me about my last year in high school it's pretty confusing, I just remember parts and not in order. Depression, anxiety, fear or strangers, panic attacks and dissociation would come and go. 
Sometimes I'd just not feel anything, and sometimes I'd be angry at people for not understanding me.
I started doing therapy and slowly healing but still found it hard to deal with my emotions.

Eventually, I went to this Buddhist temple and started meditating, which really helped me and brought me back to reality. I stopped having panick attacks and was able to not think about it so much.
Going to college also helped, cause it felt like a new stage of life and I quit therapy because I felt no need to keep going.

He ended his life by placing trash bags around his head and securing them tightly. We believe he may have also used some medicine or alcohol to make him drowsy but we are still awaiting toxicology results. By the time we got there the bags were removed from his body but layed beside him. Initially seeing him helped calm my mind. I had created a much more gruesome picture in my head and truly he looked very peaceful like he was just taking a nap on his bed. We also found his cellphone, he made a playlist on YouTube titled ""the end"" and it was the last thing he listened to. The playlist contained only songs from Weezer, which happened to be one of my favorite bands. 

I was sitting downstairs in their living room when the staff from the funeral home came to collect him. The thing that broke me, was hearing them zip up his body. I guess at that point it became real to me. Seeing him at his viewing also ruined me. He looked nothing like himself. He was caked with so much makeup but I could still see the bruising. 

Since then, I cant sleep a full 8 hours. I think the most I've gotten in one night straight was 4 hours. I wake up continuously, often laying awake until my alarm goes off for work. When I do sleep, I'm often having nightmares.  I dreamed last night my son was dead. The night before that my cousin died all over again. 

During the day and at work, I'm exhausted, snippy, overeating or not eating at all. I have crying spells daily, the simplest things remind me of everything. I cant take out the trash anymore. It upsets me too much. I cant listen to Weezer anymore. I went to their concert last summer with my husband which happened to be his first concert. That is no longer a happy memory for me. I often get flashbacks seeing his body.

I explained this to my sister and she suggested it may be beyond grief, it may be PTSD. I have been going to therapy, and my next appointment is in Thursday. Any thoughts?

670;670;2306_ptsd;"Guilt for Having PTSD Hi. I just joined this community because I was feeling alone in my mental struggle.

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD but I feel extremely guilty saying I have it. Mainly, because when I read the things most people who have PTSD have gone through, I feel like I don’t deserve to have it. You are all so strong and amazing and I don’t think I could have survived or functioned through even half of the stuff you guys have.

The reason I have PTSD is because I experienced loss and change and ups and downs very quickly and simultaneously all at once and I think the whiplash is getting me. But, mostly, I was in a very toxic job and I had two bosses that just sucked the life out of me. They teased me for having anxiety and tried to ruin my chances of ever being hired anywhere else. They were controlling and condescending and two faced and I got to a point where I could barely walk in the work building without thinking I was having a heart attack.

I’m finally out of that job and on to better things, but the PTSD still gets me. I still get really really angry out of nowhere. I cry uncontrollably for what feels like no reason. I remember all the things that were said to me by my previous bosses and I swear it feels like I’m reliving it all over again. I can’t make it go away.

I’m sorry I’m posting this. I feel weak and dumb for saying it on a forum where, like I said, so many people have it a million times worse. I feel pathetic that just a little job situation has given me diagnosed PTSD ... and I haven’t been in war or gone through abuse ... like how can I even have the right to say that??? I wish I was stronger mentally. I wish I wasn’t frail and scared and pathetic ... and I wish my body and mind didn’t see all this as traumatic to me. I’m mad tonight ... and I feel like my mental progress is like taking 5 steps forward and 7 steps back. And I don’t know ... I’m  just inspired by so many of you sharing your experiences. Thank you for this forum and I’m sorry that I hardly have any right to be in it.";0

641;641;1094_ptsd;"Had a ptsd episode and don't know what came over me....any words of encouragement? Trigger warning for sexual assault here!

I experienced CSA growing up and have only begun to unpack it now in my 20s so it has been pretty distressful for me. I am still dealing with it pretty hard, but usually, I can get a handle on it. Today I was triggered by a movie I was watching and I ended up having a full-blown episode where I had a meltdown and felt like I had to go out to some random bar or dangerous neighborhood and willingly seek out and put myself into another ""sexual assult-y"" situation in order to cope with my overwhelming feelings. This has happened to me many times before so I knew I needed to just stay put and let the feelings pass. I did and eventually, the unbearable urge to put myself at risk went away.

But then I felt so much shame, so so so much shame. I was so shocked at my reaction it's like something came over me to try to seek out such a dangerous situation (I guess my mind is trying to make me act out the trauma again). I also figure I had to stay put in bad sexual situations as a child so my brain thinks I need to do that to survive now as an adult. I'm trying to practice self-kindness and talk about the original traumatic events in therapy, but it still is so overwhelming to go through.

1024;1024;2012_ptsd;"Hallucinations occurring frequently (NSFW) (Marked NSFW due to potentially triggering content)

Just a little backstory. I've suffered from PTSD since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 20 now) and diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18. For years, I would have nightmares where I would relive the experience, which seems pretty common. When I got to about 14, I would go about 2 or 3 days without sleeping to avoid these nightmares because I didn't know how to cope with them. When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.

The dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating. Everything was going as planned until about 20 minutes in. At this point, I was hearing a man speaking aggressively in French (much like Jacques Brel, but the voice sounded deeper). I'm not fluent in French, so whatever I was hearing is a mystery. The next day a similar thing happened after a nightmare except this time it sounded like a low-flying airplane was in my head. It was loud enough to scare me out of meditation and make my heart race. 

The nightmares have been less frequent since then. I have, however, been experiencing more straightforward hallucinations. Every few hours or so, I'll see a humanoid figure in the corner of my eye. Like someone is behind me watching me. More recently I've also been seeing shadow-like figures running around right in front of me. The other night I was in my girlfriend's room watching a show with her when I noticed in the other corner of the room a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye. I couldn't focus on it enough to make out any features, but I did my best to make sure I really saw something. When I finally glanced over, it was gone. She knew something was up, as I seemed distracted (or maybe she sensed my terror) and asked me what was wrong. I just said I thought I saw something. 

I'm afraid to come forward about all of this to anyone in my everyday life. I'm afraid people may think there's something wrong with me. I just need someone to verify that this is normal with PTSD and not another mental illness. I'd also appreciate any anecdotes or advice. Thank you in advance. This has just been scary. I felt like I was doing well for so long. ";0
750;750;1436_ptsd;"Hands On Again 3 or 4 months ago my boyfriend put his hands on me.  6 months pregnant and this guy had my face to the ground with his hand around neck leaving pretty red marks on dark skin.  As soon as he let me go I scoured away like a hurt puppy and started having a panic attack.  At least I think that’s what it was.  I found it hard to breath.  Each breathe was hard to catch and felt like my first after deep sea diving.  I was shaking, scared to believe this guy just hurt me.

Today that ‘panic’ feeling came back.  What started as a back and forth argument turned into him ‘playing around’ with me.  Him behind me, covered my mouth and nose and just pulled my face back and my neck was straining.  I panicked because I’m 35 weeks now and the baby started tightening in my belly.  I couldn’t really breath.  I tried pulling his hands back away from my mouth to tell him to stop but his weight pushed me down into the couch making things harder.  By the time I got him to let go he started to pat my back as I gasped for air like the first night.  He asked me if I was ok..  I was shaking and I just repeated the same words as I did before, “please just get away from me”.  

I think that was a ptsd moment - I don’t know.  But since then I can’t even stand to be in the same room as him.  He says he was playing around but I know that wasn’t a game.  I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.  That was the scariest part.  It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion.

I don't know how many people he told, but I was told I could no longer go to church (unless I went before 6 elders to confess 'my' sin.)  I feel ashamed already, but also, if I talk about what he did, then I get him in trouble also, so I don't quite get what to do there.  You guys, any ideas?  

He implied to me early on that he was suicidal, that I should keep the relationship secret, (I felt almost threatened),  I still felt horribly guilty, that I was going to go to hell, and I still feel that way, even though I try to trust in Jesus to forgive all my sins.  But I have yet to accuse him to anyone, it's like I am still protecting him, when I really would like my name back, etc.  

I isolate myself in my small community.  I don't want to hurt his wife, or take his job away, or his family, or his reputation, even though he has taken my reputation for no reason, my name, and made me feel like garbage, and completely valueless.  Like I have no voice.  Like I do not matter. 

What would you do?  It's actually even more complicated, I'm just writing the bare outline here.  Every day, I make a decision to protect him, even though he has given me nothing but enduring and ongoing pain.  I don't want to see him hurt.  But at some point I deserve to have a life, and have my name cleared, at least half of it.  I don't want to treat him like he has treated me.  but doing nothing does not feel right either.  I don't want to be vengeful.  

Any thoughts?  Two of my brothers even made me feel guiltier than I already did.  ""Gee, like next time I feel like shit, I'll just call you guys, (my brothers) because I know you'll make me feel worse, not be kind in my confession. ""  

I was also doing informal counseling with this guy,  I had already had cPTSD from prior physical and sexual abuse in my life.  Thanks for your responses.  I am really interested in any practical or kind ideas, even for him.  Is there anything simple I could do, that would gently clear my name?  Or is it just going to get worse?  I also happen to know that there are leadership in that church who have had affairs, and done unethical business deals, cheating their partners.  Yet they go unscathed.  

It's a little late tonight, and it's Christmas Day tomorrow, so I might not check this real quickly, but I will eventually.  Thank you.

913;913;1862_ptsd;"Has anyone experienced hypervigilance, and found a way to heal it? I live in a severe state of hypervigilance due to trauma, which pretty much means my nervous system is hyperaroused constantly. I have zero ability to relax, rest, or sleep. I can ""do"" relaxing things (meditation included here) but I do not actually relax, as I remain in a state of fight or flight and mental unrest. I am always hyperaware of my surroundings in a subconscious attempt to protect myself, and my fear of letting go of consciousness (insomnia) is a result of that. 

I no longer experience flashbacks or acute symptoms after years of healing, but the hypervigilance remains. I am still in therapy for trauma. I'm not sure what the answer is, but not sleeping and not being able to rest is exhausting. ";0

847;847;1572_ptsd;"Has anyone's appetite actually increased after PTSD? TW: ED I had an eating disorder as a teenager that ran until I was around 21. It went from restricting myself at 14 to only eating \~1000 calories a day to binging and purging weekly for the next 8 years. 6 months before my trauma, I decided to end it. I started eating more and healthier and lifting weights instead of the \~80 minutes of cardio a day I was doing. I felt amazing.

Then the trauma happened, and fitness was one of the interests I lost when the depression and PTSD hit. I couldn't sleep and had a very busy schedule, so I relied on (mainly junk) food to get me through all-nighters and long shifts. This turned to a comfort thing where I would down Ben and Jerry's and blame my depression. I couldn't even go back to doing cardio because an elevated heart-rate felt like a panic attack. Unsurprisingly, I gained 15 pounds, which is a lot on my 5'1 body.

It's been a year and some months, and I'm safe again. I have my degree, a job, my own apartment, and stability. Yet all I want to do is lose this weight I gained. I associate it with the worst year of my life and everything in me wants to just go back to the ""old me"" before the trauma and, in hand, the weight gain. Yet I'm so scared this restriction is going to lead to my eating becoming disordered again.

I have tried dieting, but I can't get myself to use calorie tracking apps and when I get too hungry I just...eat. I don't think about my allotted macros for the day or if I'm above or below my protein goal or if the food I'm eating ""fits in my macros"" anymore. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating with no restrictions and I still have my daily fruits and veggies. I'm also still very into weight-lifting and go to the gym 6 days a week still. I guess I just don't have the passion to diet and exercise like I used to for weight loss, though.

I hear all the time about people with PTSD not eating and withering away because of the traumatic event they had to endure. Has anybody else experienced the opposite, though- relying on food to cope? It's hard for me to relate to most stories about PTSD because so many talk about experiencing nausea and an inability to eat - but the only thing I cared about after my trauma was eating. Maybe my history of heavy restriction caused my appetite increase after the trauma as a way of preventing myself from going down that path again. I don't know.";0

1181;1181;2430_ptsd;"Having a hard time opening up to loved ones TW for all of this (rape, assault)

I’m 20 years old, female. When I was freshly 16, I was raped during a party in a small apartment, with the door open, and nobody helped me. I began acting out and getting in a lot of trouble after this, ultimately landing myself in acute inpatient for suicidal thoughts. I wrote my parents a letter telling them what happened to me, and social workers had to come in the hospital and report it with me. They never, ever contacted me or my parents EVER again. That alone is its own damage. 
2 years later, freshly 18 now, I began working as a houseman in a hotel. This means I cleaned everything except for inside the actual rooms. Well, there was a man that would stay Monday-Thursday for his construction job. He took an interest in me quickly, asking my age, where I go to school, then progressing into telling me I have “beautiful bedroom eyes” and “pure ness in my smile” I knew he was up to something. He then began asking me which car is mine, when do I get off work, will my parents be waiting on me to come home from work tonight, etc. I began to be paranoid even when I left work, getting trapped in moments of my 16 year old self, thinking nobody cares what would happen to me, because after all, the police don’t care about me.  At one point he entered the lady’s restroom where I was cleaning, had me in a corner, touched my arm and asked how I like the new job. :( 
One day, and this is so hard for me to tell because it became a repressed memory until my second hospitalization in October 2019, I was vacuuming the second floor hallway. Humming to myself probably, at the very start of this floor, the door to my left opened quickly. An arm, with orange hair and freckles, oh my god this is it, an arm grabs me. It was the man. He held me just inside the room, my left foot in the doorway. He told me to look in his eyes, gripped my arm tighter, and held me there. I was thinking to myself that this is it, he has me. He could’ve done whatever he wanted. It felt like my eyes were looking into his for years, and his eyes, they were like... glass. Empty, yet fiery.  My mind made me see myself, naked, beaten, raped, and left all alone in the woods to rot. He let me go and I finished my shift. I was in a state of denial, showing up to my following shift in the morning. When I got to the second floor again, I actually passed out, and I’ve never passed out! I completely fell to the ground, it felt like I swallowed a rock. 
Long story, but my entire 2018 consisted of horrible paranoid thoughts and migraines, but I had forgotten this incident for a long time, so my therapist and I had a hard time getting it under control. Now that I remember, my life is bad. I have also borderline personality disorder that causes me MUCH distress on a daily basis, but now I’m miserable. I have flashbacks during the day time, I can’t even take the trash out alone. I’ve lost all my friends. My relationships are shallow and meaningless, except for my boyfriend. I never feel safe. I have gotten to the point of accusing my father of trying to rape me (absolutely delusional, he’s never touched me) and had similar accusations to my friends and even my boyfriend at some points. Sometimes, when the flashbacks are bad and I can’t afford to buy my medical marijuana, I get stuck in loops of seeing my dead and raped body again. It’s horrible. I’m scared to tell my family what happened because it seems like... nothing happened. Nothing happened but I spend everyday asking myself if this existence is even fucking worth it.

TLDR; I already told my family about a trauma, and now I feel this new trauma is not enough to trouble them over. Or trouble myself over anymore.";1

&amp;#x200B;

Met a girl on Tinder, she was in poly lifestyles before she met me, we ended up going out and she became monogamous for me. In 3 short weeks she put me in her Instagram bio with my initials, she paid for a full Disney World Vacation and a cottage retreat. She would call me boo and do all of this extra stuff. A little disclaimer this chick is on all sorts of bi polar medication and is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.

So one week, she tells me she is angry because she has a bump on her lip, she was like "" I have herpes on my lip I can't go to work"" I played it off but later asked her, "" oh did u just get herpes?"" And she said "" I have been having herpes 1 since collage"" So basically she withheld that information from me and told me when I OBV would see the bump.

Another week she told me she was on this medication Triliptoial (for seizures and Bi Polar) A thing she did not mention to me is that the ENTIRE time we were using BC and having unprotected sex, her Triliptoal meds reduce it's effectiveness by 49%, she later retracted the statement and said her doctor upped her BC to counter act it.

In May (on my birthday ) we went to a cottage resort and by the end of the night FLIPPED out on me for letting her pay for everything, We ended up getting into a fight and broke up. We later got back later that week. She told me she had an ex once that wanted to move in with her after 4 months and they got into a fight and broke up ( I wonder if she love bombed him as well)

Everything was good until June &amp; she randomly tells me she sent her Ex a love letter and that she misses him.

It ends up in a fight because I felt betrayed. She then starts drinking every single night again.

Mid June she tells me she wants to be poly again &amp; I agree with her because I just wanted her in my life.

Everything is fine until last week when she trys to pick and create arguments. She would rage on me for speaking

to loudly to the waiter, and would rag on me for not saying please and thank u. we end up breaking up today due

to all of her emotional abuse, she then texts me saying it is fucked up of me to call her out on her behavior.

Anyways when she was yelling at me I only heard a ringing noise and my vision started to turn black. I wasn't really able to see her but I heard her clearly. I remember that I didn't say anything cause I was too scared admit it to her and getting into more trouble.
Right now I haven't been spanked (or hit) but I just remember it vividly and I don't have the guys to tell my mother about it. I remember my mother saying how ""liars go to hell"", ""why'd you lie about your grades? I would have found out anyways"", ""why do I take you to tutor when you'll just get B's?"", ""look at me"" and ""why are you crying?""

Anyways I feel guilty... I recently heard she had rheumatism (I think) right after I was born. I'm the only child right now and I just feel like I have to get good grades so I can do something... I guess

I took my charmain hiney to the hospital in a major panic and disassociative episode last night. Can't  sleep because my sleep are nightmares, can function bc I cant sleep. Erupted in an uncontrollable rage and panic last night because of some effed up intrusive and totally unreal thoughts.

I took a Lyft bc i didn't wanna panic my boyfriend and mostly asking for help from anyone in my life or to do something about abuse has never gone well and victim blaming is a thing. You see last year my brother strangled me to unconsciousness and left me for dead. His wife absconded with their kids bc she is a nurse and didnt want to lose her job. They left me in their house to die and when my mom picked me up I was pretty beat up amd she asked me what I did....lol...All for bringing his wife home 10 minutes too late (he hates himself and her and has alway always wanted me dead bc I took everything from him...you know by not doing drugs and studying and earning scholarships for college sure seems unfair.) Cuckoo.

Sitting there, naked in a robe, zoned tf out with tears down my cheeks and a bag of piss sample, I could just see and hear nurses making rude gestures. It was empty in the ER and the only time I've ever felt unsafe for myself, i couldnt even feel safe there. I finally asked to be seen, they ignored me. They took all my belongings and phone and i just needed to call my fiance to pick me up bc i could feel a huge trigger (sweating profusely, rapid talk, hypervigilant). I said i really didn't want to be there so unless they're checking me in, ill go. A dude  nurse walks by and laughs ""good, go then""......uhm all I saw was red. That's alllllll it took for me to cuss him out, threaten litigation, speak to their head staff and demand my belongings and to tell me ""tell me how tf do you act when your brother tries to kill you and you lose the only kids youl ever have niece and nephew"". They were in the wrong and the security staff apologized as did the doctor. Doesnt matter, i wont be seeking help from the er ever again and i get to deal with the embarassment of losing my shit thinking im a victim again. Ughh.

A history of child physical and sexual abuse, extreme poverty, absentee parents , extreme bullying and racial prejudice from whites and blacks bc I am mixed, an emotionally abusive and cheating gay ex husband, watching friends die in front of me, painful endometriosis, bullying at work, physical attacks and most recently my brother tried to kill me.

Spent all of my life ignoring the effed upness of everything because being alienated or told your different sure makes you not wanna put on anything but a happy face...until my body and brain broke, which happened one night outside of a club in 2017 when a black woman threw me to the ground and choked me because i walked by her and  apparently thought I was ""just some cute lightskinned girl."" After, i went into a dissociation and been stuck in it since.

You see, i can write all those things down now but those are things no one knew of me. I am smart, educated, used to be kind, and definitely goofy/quick witted. My kindness has often been easy for manipulative people to exploit and since speaking up didnt work as a child, I just laughed about everything....the manager whos wife sent me nudes and tried to groom me for a threesome outta nowhere, the other manager who hated me because I excelled at what I did and ridiculed and alienated me from staff, the perverts who knew i was naive to men, etc...

But I really want to help him out and be there for him, but it is difficult. Sometimes he opens up and we talk a lot, but many times he shuts off and easily loses trust and gets angry at me too.

74;74;48_ptsd;"How can i help my 16year old friend with PTSD Hey folks so heres the deal,

Background: my 16 year old friend just came out about sexual and physical abuse from her asshole father 2 months ago. There is an ongoing complex intense court battle between the 2 of them and her family (who admittedly have always been distant) have chosen to side with the father and isolate/ostracize my friend. She has been on and off again homeless, and because of this, she made the healthy decision to move in with me and has become apart of my family. 
I love my friend, she desperately wants to overcome this but is struggling with a lot of symptoms, and myself and my parents want to learn how to help her any way we can. 
She has these dreams where she wakes up panicking and sweating. Last time she told me that she couldnt stop going over what happened in her head, and although i stayed with her, it took a long time for her to fall back asleep.
She also has flashbacks where she goes in and out of the present and past. For example last week after volleyball she was triggered by the noisy change room and ended up standing in the corner unresponsive to anyone repeating the words ""its my fault"". I ended up getting her alone away from the rest of the team but i need strategies on how to get her out of the flashback. Ive noticed that when shes a present the hypersensitivity kicks in and everythings crazy loud for her but then she cant hear anything when shes back in her flashback. Sometimes it helps to give a hug or hold her hand sometimes it terrifies or irritates her. I dont know how to get her out of it and i hate to see her that terrified. 
The hypersensitivity can be super hard too around the house, sometimes shes able to say that something like the dryer is too loud otherwise we'll find her in the corner of her room with her head between her legs in a panic attack. 
We desperately want strategies to help bring her out of a flashback/dissociation, panic attack, night terrors and just the general feeling of loneliness and betrayal she deals with daily. Also note we just started her with a counsellor who she says is helping a lot, this is just for at home and school. Really and insight into ptsd would be super helpful as were all still trying to comprehend it.

Even though it’s been almost 6 years I can’t shake the feeling of going to panic mode and feeling absolutely sick every time I have to drive by it. Also due to being a small town there’s not really many alternative routes I can take to avoid it.

After my surgery, a hole appeared in the floor of my mouth. A surgeon came into my 6 bed bay at 2am and using local anaesthetic stitched up the floor of my mouth by a flashlight that her assistant was holding, she stabbed me through the lip (which wasn't numbed) a couple of times and the next day I found out she hadn't done it properly and still had a hole. The surgeon  wanted me to go under General and get it sorted but I was too scared and so let it heal naturally which took 3 weeks on NG tube which made me sick. I have bad veins also and was stabbed numerous times every day by people trying to find veins for canulars or to take bloods. 2 doctors gave me a nose bleed because they were trying to very forcefully shove a large NG tube that was the wrong size up my nose. My dietician  restricted my water and I had severe dehydration headaches all weekend while she was off and no one would up my water intake because her word is law or whatever. Anyway long story short, it was a lash up and lots of horrible things happened to me along with just trying to deal with getting cancer and going through treatment. So since then I have nightmares every night, I can't sleep, I grind my teeth all day getting angry at how (I've tried) but can't get any help for what happened to me and psychological help. So it didn't really click until I went for an eye test and they did the glaucoma air pressure test and I completely broke down. I was so embarrassed because the lady doing it clearly didn't get it, it's only a burst of air to the eye, it doesn't hurt. Which I get.

I still care a lot about my ex. I know a lot of people would say stay away, they’re not your issue anymore but I simply cannot leave them because I care.

My ex has been through a lot. Child abuse, job at 15 to pay off the house, texts from her dad all the time after he left about how much he hates her, sexually assaulted twice, sexually abused, physically abused, abortion, etc.

I listen to everything she says and give her validation but I’m not really sure what to do after that. I’ll make sure she’s not in pain, be there in person when she needs me, and everything I could try.

Loss of friendship, depression, anxiety, low key suicidal, emotionally broken, sexual discomfort

I don't know if the stuff I'm about to write is actually triggering, but I'd rather post a warning too many than too few. 
There is no violence or physical/real life confrontation in the post to come. It took place via chat. 

Hey all. First time here - let me start by saying thank you for having this community. 
I am sorry my first post is gonna be jumping right in and asking for help, but I have nowhere else to turn. 
My friends can only do so much and my therapy sessions are cancelled for at least 2 weeks as my entire country is on lockdown of all non-essential things. 


So, here goes. 
3 days ago was a day as days normally are. Get up, eat some, whatever else. 
However, completely out of the blue I get a message from a guy I considered my best real life friend. A guy I have had movie weekends with, making costumes, crafting jewellery, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a lot of hugging and a ton of common interests. 
I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying this guy might be the best part about my daily life in real life(except for the hobbies that keep me busy and alive). 
In the message, less than 2 weeks after we hung out, laughed, talked and hugged, he wrote to me that he realized it was gonna seem like thunder from a clear sky, but he didn't feel comfortable around me anymore and because he was unable to tell me when something was crossing a boundary of his he had to end our friendship effective immediately. 
The behaviour he was triggered by was what I considered normal jokes. Normal jokes with awcual undertones, pretty normal stuff. But what I didn't know was that he has a traumatic past that made such jokes incredibly uncomfortable to him and he never told me I was crossing his boundaries so I did not see it coming a mile away, especially since he and I had been together and had fun shortly before then. 

I cried for several hours, just looking at my computer at nothing, crying and wiping my face. When I was done crying I started imagining what I was gonna do now. And the thought of suicide entered my mind and presented itself as a logical option to solve all my problems. I don't think I'm gonna make an attempt, in my 30 years I haven't ever, but the fact that the thought entered my mind and seemed like a reasonable option scared me. 

I made it through the day. And I slept. But things didn't get better. 
Since then I've been unable to find the motivation to live. I am a hobby artist and usually I am so passionate and active that I forget to go to bed and sometimes remember that I haven't showered for 2 days. Gross, I know, but that should say something about the magnitude of my obsession with my hobbies. 
For the last 3 days I have done none of it. I have been immersing myself in a large computer game to disconnect from reality. I have a constant sadness and it feels like my entire body is slugging through a hot, dry environment but without being dry. My chest feels like it's being compressed. Whenever I stop and let my mind rest my pulse starts racing and I feel an overwhelming anxiety. 
And since then I have hated myself and my own sexuality to the point where just thinking about sexual desires or activity will make me nauseated, guilty, sad, angry and deeply uncomfortable. 

How do you all deal with being traumatized like this? I was already fragile, but I was making real progress. Now it feels like I've been dragged 5 years back, like being pulled backwards into a vat of icy water, struggling to get back up. 
I don't remember the last time I felt this broken. I feel like I've lost everything. And I have no idea what to do.

I won’t go into tons of details about what happened with me, but someone very very close to me almost died, nearly a year ago now. It was a very stressful situation and I was critical in saving their life, and I was very close to the situation as it developed (if you need more elaboration I can try).

Afterwards I didn’t immediately go to therapy; it was at least a couple months. I was dependent on my mom to make the appointment and I wasn’t insistent enough; I didn’t actually feel like it was necessary at the time.

I posted on another sub the other day about how my sex life had been really affected by this, and I mentioned other things, that I got panic attacks when I never did before, insomnia (or, alternatively, relentless fatigue), and very moderate depression. I had, and still have, in some areas, pretty sever anxiety with things related to the event (such as ambulances, sirens, hospitals, etc, along with more specific situational things) and I couldn’t drive for a while because I’d have to pull over quite often to calm myself down.

I didn’t mention PTSD in the post, but in the comments someone said that it sounded like PTSD. I vehemently disagree; I don’t ever want to be the type to recklessly self-diagnose and I flat out don’t think that this is anywhere near the level of PTSD. But it’s stuck in my brain and I can’t get it out.

My question is, how do you know? Like what’s the line, not in a gatekeeping way but in a diagnosing way? Is there some more moderate thing that I’m looking for to define my experience? I was planning on going back to therapy, but that’s not happening anymore, obviously, and I just feel like I’m being dramatic and ignoring myself at the same time. Literally anything helps.♥️♥️";0

I don’t know if they’re flashbacks, I know they’re dreams, but they’re traumatic in themselves because of the disgusting images I’m left with when I wake up. It’s horrifying and overwhelming. 

I recently made huge headway in therapy and have finally learned to stop dissociating/going numb, something I’ve done for my entire life. Now that I can feel, I’m drowned in emotion, sadness, anger, hurt, but that’s good because I’m finally really feeling everything. It’s the not being able to calm myself down and help myself feel safe again that’s the problem. I’m going to see a psychiatrist to see if I can get meds for the chronic nightmares (it’s been an entire year now), but in the meantime I don’t know how to calm myself when I’m emotionally overwhelmed.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think a lot about PTSD until a year or two ago when I just sorta got hit full force with something I didn't understand. As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything. That worked okay for a few years, although I was really struggling mentally during that time, but then the wheels just came off at some point where I was too messed up in the brain to operate normally in society.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get these nightmares that were so bad that they wanted to use me as an experiment for a new drug that's being trialed for use by the U.S. Military. I forget what it's called but essentially it's this blood pressure medication, but when you take it you never dream again for the rest of your life. I mean these nightmares were so insane I actually thought I might be possessed by a demon and considered seeking help from a priest.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get this anxiety that got so bad that I could not turn my back to someone or all this other weird shit. I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from. It was like I was being poisoned surreptitiously or something. I thought I was a tough guy but this was like physiological in nature. It made me so sick sometimes that I'd puke for days and not be able to sleep and I'd get dehydrated and have to go to the ER and get saline and a MRI.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I went to some therapist because I thought I had an anxiety disorder or something, but they were like no you got PTSD. I didn't believe it at the time, I was like ""yeah right"", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood/brain/skull/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;

I got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.

&amp;#x200B;

They operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.

&amp;#x200B;

They forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some ""creative"" interrogation or whatever) they never recover. This is a concept I'm only becoming aware of now.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is with triggers. In fact, it got so bad that I had to quit my job six months ago and I've been out of work since then and barely left my house in all that time in order to avoid triggers/stimuli. Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say ""hands kill"" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people. If I trust someone enough to tell them what I've just posted here they see me as broken and crazy and want nothing to do with me. So it's kind of a lose-lose situation and I've been on my own with this for about 13 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't stay in my house forever and never go outside again so what can I do to bring myself back into the fold when I hit one of those triggers? Even when I'm doped up on tranquilizers it doesn't always fully stop the rush of memories and sensations that come flooding into my soul. I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

After I told a friend I had been assaulted he tried to be supportive over text but stopped wanting to see me in person (he claimed he was really busy with work but it was kind of a thin excuse as it mostly applied just to seeing me, not anyone else). While its gotten a little better recently after I kind of told him I was upset that I had rarely seen him in months and that I thought it was linked to disclosure, I still feel like things arent the same anymore and it feels like the whole friendship is on thin ice. He's normally a pretty emotionally supportive person but I realize this kind of thing can be taken really differently. I still feel like there is this underlying tension, probably because he still says its because work was and has been really busy and so while I see him more often now (but not as often as before I said anything) i feel like the same thing can happen again at any moment if I do or say the wrong thing (like mentioning or alluding to assault at all).

This ever happen with anyone else? Advice on how to deal with friend?

And advice about how to deal with the impact of this on myself? Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad. But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame. I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it. I had told one friend over skype and she was supportive over text as well and didn't stop texting me or anything like that but I havent talked about it to her at all in person since she moved to the same city as me so I guess a part of me is worried she'd react the same way (not wanting to see me in person) even though she hasnt done anything like that.

I may try a new medication. Antidepressants were ok but kind of turned into an unfeeling zombie, which wasn’t good either.

It’s hard to describe, but the vigilance goes beyond traditional anxiety and it can be embarrassing. I don’t like it if it affects the mood of others around me, or even makes people want to stay away.

On my way back, a druggie said HEY BEAUTIFUL and eating me alive with his eyes. I didnt even acknowledge his presence. He stopped, and yelled back at me, you cant even say hi you white bitch. 

I'm walking to the subway and a group of younger city kids pass me, they start saying stuff to me and when they pass me, I still hear them. I say ""stfu"" as I pass them, fed up with the fucking day. They stop and threaten to fight me. 

I'm walking to get my dinner and on my way home a homeless man is screaming MISS MISS following me, I sprinted away. 

There is a building of projects across from me. Everytime I walk out there are these druggies lingering right across from me. I'm paranoid they know where I live. 

I'm going for a run and walking through the block to get to the river. I hear a guy say hi and whistling from a car parked on the street, but I didnt see which one it was coming from. 

I was walking to the river another day and a homeless drugged up man started saying hi and walking towards me and when I didnt respond and walked away he screamed IM GONNA GET YOU til I was out of distance. 

I go on the subway.. WITH my boyfriend for the first time in a while. A bunch of city kids get on and start doing a very very loud, screaming, violent type performance. I was triggered and they were stomping back and forth down the train cart. It was so long til the next stop. They kept coming over to us and across from me was the only other white girl on the cart. He puts his fist out for her to pound it. She didnt at first but he didnt move, so she did. Then he comes over to me and puts his fuckin fist out. My bf put his hand in front of me and pounded him for me. He walked away. He did this to the only two white girls on the train, even when I was with my bf. 

I was on a train alone and a bunch of city kids got on and were hanging from the subway handles and started talking shit about white girls and dumb bitches. 

I was walking to my apartment and heard a guysaying, blondie, blondieee behind me. 

I was walking on the river and a city guy passed me and said PUT A SMILE ON. Then I gave him a death stare and he called me a bitch. 

I've been raped by one of these city, drug dealer type guys. I live in this city alone. In my hometown these types of bad people would stalk me and pick on me for some reason. I'm a walking target. I dont feel safe leaving my house to go to the corner store. I'm scared to go on the subway to go ANYWHERE now. I dont have money to uber everywhere. It's so hard cause this could be real danger. It's so triggering and idk what to do. There is no one I know in this city or state. My bf is 2.5 hours away and very busy working full time. I am no contact and estranged from all family members and friends. I have a new therapist but even getting to her office is a fucking long trigger. 

AND WHAT PISSES ME OFF IS THAT.......if you dont respond to these people.. they WILL retaliate. And how fucked up is that? How fucked up is it to go on a subway and have a stranger shove their hand in your face for a ""pound."" And what if she didnt do it? She had no choice but to touch a fucking strangers hand that was invading her personal space, minding her own business on the train. They get mad when they are rejected because they look like idiots, when they are trying to be cool and have game when they do it. Are they trying to scare me on purpose? Are they this stupid? I shouldnt have to deal with this:-( I need a body guard.

So I guess I need to settle for something in the middle. What sucks is that I am all alone.. I have no money or support... idk where I'll be at the end of the month.... my bf was supposed to get us a place but he bailed on me.. now I'm on my own.

263;263;235_ptsd;"Hyper-vigilance in the classroom Hi there, I've been scrolling through here for a good half-hour now and I think i might be able to get some advice here.   


I don't qualify as having PTSD, but I suffer from generalized anxiety, depression, and the occasional psychotic symptoms (usually triggered by extreme stress). I'm being treated for all of these things, but my therapist mentioned hyper-vigilance and survivors guilt and I figured I'd look into it myself. My current problem is similar to descriptions of hyper-vigilance, and I thought it might be worth asking about here.

&amp;#x200B;

tw// suicide mentions, murder/suicide, gun violence, school shootings  


A little bit of background: While I was in high school, I was intensely suicidal. It was really, really bad. On top of that, every year I attended (Freshman, Sophomore, and half of my Junior year) someone died. Two were plain suicides and one was a murder/suicide, in which a gun was brought on campus. I dropped out and got my GED and it's been a few years since, and I've decided to go to community college. I really want to be able to live comfortably. I want to learn and push forward and try to find which career I'd like to pursue, and since I'm just uncertain about everything (and can't work a retail job to save my life) junior college seems right.   


As the date of my first class is getting closer, The anxiety about the situation keeps growing. I'm terrified that my hyper-vigilance is going to affect my work. In restaurants and at shows (like a friend's aerial arts performance) I cannot sit with my back to the door without either whipping around or having a panic attack. More recently it's been easier, but sometimes that's not even enough. Most classrooms are situated with student's backs to the door and if I have to keep examining the room and looking over my shoulder, I don't know what I'll do. Additionally, loud noises like objects being dropped scare the shit out of me and will throw me right into a loop if I can't quickly identify it.  


I don't know how to cope in that situation. I don't know how I'm going to cope sitting on campus between classes without freaking out about the possibility of someone coming in to hurt me. I was hoping someone might have advice here, because honestly the way that I've coped up to this point is by facing the door or having my back to a wall and watching every new person that comes in the room until my brain is satisfied.   


tl; dr: experiencing a symptom of PTSD without actual diagnosis/thinking i actually have PTSD, but am reaching out because of how one aspect of my anxiety behaves. I have a hard time coping with crowds and academic environments because I believe someone is going to hurt me (and others) and I go into a hyper-vigilant state, how could I cope with it when my usual methods won't be able to be used?

It's so unpleasant and literally makes me want to claw my skin off. I know things like alcohol and xanax help it go away, but I don't wanna rely on either of those for obvious reasons. ;1

I always get episodes of hypervigilance and extreme aggressiveness. I'm always looking for a threat, thinking ""If this guy looks funny at me I'm gonna rip his face off "". Of course I don't want to hurt anyone and have never done so in my adult life. 
I call this my ""fight mode"". 

I  have the suspicion that quitting my meds messed with my hormone levels or something. That I put on a significant amount of muscle mass while simultaneously losing fat, which shouldn't really be possible at my training level points in that direction. Are maybe my testosterone levels too high? Or is that really just in my mind?

144;144;564_ptsd;"I am a college student and I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment. Help Long story, but read if you can. 

I came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. 

About a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. 

Lots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. 

The day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. 

I woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear ""COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said ""one sec"" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. 

During this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. 

The main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.

I explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. 

After the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. 

I showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. 

Since I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. 

It got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. 

Do I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. 

I miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often.

All of whom lived with us. The male helper and I used to spend lots of time together. I grew attached to him. I don’t remember exact moments but I remember singular pictures here and there of it. He was a well loved member of our family. In the beginning I never told anyone what he was doing to me. I loved and adored him, but absolutely hated what he did to me. He basically used my mouth as a whole.

Slowly after he left us, I was always confused as to what to make of it. Never telling anyone as I was scared that nobody would believe me. Eventually I told my older sister. This was when I was about 18 years old. She then forced me to tell my parents. 

After I told my parents, nothing was ever said about it. My biggest fear of not being believed was coming to life. This year when I am 24 years old I found out through my counsellor (whom I begged to see) that my dad doesn’t believe me.

I have lost my ability to do anything. The whole in my body and feeling of worthlessness has never been greater. I have this hatred that has built up for my father. I love my mother with all of my heart, and she really tries to love and support me. My biggest fear is losing my mother.

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 7 years, she gives me an infinite amount of love and support. I constantly don’t understand how I deserve it. I hate myself. I have a about 7 friends whom I keep in close contact with who would do absolutely anything for me. I don’t understand why. I am worthless in my opinion. I don’t deserve the love and support that I get from these people.

I won’t commit suicide because of these people as I feel like it would be unfair on them. However I constantly feel like a burden to everyone. This writing is terrible, but I don’t have good words for how I feel.

918;918;2262_ptsd;"I am mixed up, and not sure what this is Trigger warnings - hospitalisation, medical issues, sibling abuse, suicide, sexual assault, forced hospital admissions, coming out trans, friend rejection.

Sorry this is a long one, but I promise there is a point. 

So, I grew up with a sister who psychologically abused me...and physically. She would hit me for breathing too loud, monitoring everything I did, she joined my bullies at school, she told me everyday I was shit, pathetic and nothing. She ground me down, and every time I see her, I feel total rage and want to scream. I have only been actively triggered by her a few times, and the rest of the time I just get this blind anger and rage when I see something I know she likes (animated Disney movies, Halloween, certain candy brands, etc).

I got sexually assaulted and would relive it in my dreams. I could never see his face, and I still can’t remember it, but I remember his hands. Regularly relived this for about 3 years after it happened, then it stopped. This wasn’t a rape. It was all hands. I always thought it was mild but the effect it has on me for years after Wasn’t mild. 

I came out as trans (unrelated to anything else, but being a closeted trans kid wasn’t fun in itself) and I lost friends. A lot of bad stuff went down, fed into stuff from my sister...I don’t want to go into detail, but the world became terrifying and far more dangerous over night, and I lost so many people I loved and I blamed myself for it. I still relive this stuff today.

 I tried to kill myself, mostly due to my life falling apart, anxiety and not being able to deal with whatever this is, whether it is ptsd or something else. I messed it up, thought about what my parents would think, and went for help at my local ER. They took me and locked me on a ward and wouldn’t let me leave. I still can’t go into hospitals and I have attacks whIch feel just like I did when they took me in. I can get set off now by seeing people being imprisoned on tv.

I guess what I’m asking is, are these things and my responses to them typical of ptsd? I know I should be asking a doctor but honestly, I can’t do it. I would rather die than go back to a hospital. I know that is silly but I just can’t.

I was in therapy for a year after I got out of hospital (thankfully, in an office that looked nothing like a hospital) and they never gave me a diagnosis more than “severe anxiety &amp; depression.” I suspected I had some kind of ptsd but assumed that it would have come up. Also...I’m not a war vet and my symptoms have been fairly mild compared to some of the stories on here. But then...a couple of friends of mine with ptsd told me I should think about it.

Basically, are my experiences typical of ptsd and should I push through and put myself back in the healthcare system to work this out?

\-Backstory Time

My mother was married four times, and her third husband, was addicted to pills. I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. 

My mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. 

I know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.

My mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect.

\-It's all downhill from here folks.

So how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Almost up to speed

I have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. 

It was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is?

I go to Joe’s Instagram. 

And the first thing I see in his bio is “advocate for mental health” 

You have to be fucking kidding me. 

You willfully destroyed my mental health 6 years ago. 

And now you’re getting paid to parade around the state and be an “advocate” 

I want to punch something. 
I want to cut. 
I want some kind of physical release because I can’t sit still. 
I wanna leave and go somewhere but it’s almost midnight and I have nowhere to go. 

And my friends are either not answering their phones, and the ones that do answer are being very short and just like “it’s okay. Close your eyes and breathe.” 

No. I can’t close my eyes. 
When I close my eyes I’m back where it all happened. 

Fucking advocate for mental health. 

I have PTSD because of you. 
I started having suicidal thoughts because of you. 

I had a history of abuse in the past, but it didn’t traumatize me. 
You did. You broke me. 

I was barely 18 and scared so I never reported it.

At any moment my life could have been pulled out from under me. The only thing I ever aspired to have was to feel safe, live in a house with a backyard and have a dog. And I have all that now but I still feel this urge. It’s like, I got addicted to that rush of having my life in danger.   Everything feels so painfully dull and empty I can’t stand it. It’s like, was that it? What do I do now? 

I can’t even sit in a stupid classroom(I’m in college). The whole things seems so god damn pointless. Is the fear of getting a bad grade on a test the closest I’ll ever come to how it was before? Is this it? Oh boo fucking hoo my life is ruined cuz I got a bad grade on a paper, time to go home to my house with electricity and food and without bedbugs or rats or literal shit smeared all over the floor. 

It’s like once you go through some horrible shit it all breaks and you don’t even want a normal life anymore. I don’t think I could stand the dull ness of it. For fucks sake a sick part of me got excited when my mom was having money troubles because we might lose the house and that’s a challenge. A rush. I need this pressure to live. It feels like I’m wilting without it. 


There is a part of me that wants to be a social worker, someone who can help people who are in crisis. I think I might be good at it because I know what it’s like and I would do my god dam best to help and make a difference unlike the social workers that terrorized me as a kid. Maybe that’s why I went through all that so I could go out and help others. But then I ask myself, do I want to spend the rest of my life doing an impossible job: fixing the world? I’ve already been miserable do I really want to spend the rest of my life being that way too? 

There is another part of me that wants to live in the happy cushy world. I want to like feeling safe you know? I don’t even think anyone would hire me for a job like that cuz of, Well, the ptsd. 

But you guys get the point. I need pressure. And help because I KNOW this is not a good way to live or think. Do I try to ignore this feeling, or do I use it to help others? ";0

But I knew that some things were wrong like rotten food, basic rights like phone calls, visitors, and showers being a privilege to be taken away at will.  Or even being denied a doctor or medical tests when my pre existing conditions were acting up. Some things I didn’t notice the extent until later like I didn’t realize how badly I’d been gaslighted and manipulated until the brink of insanity. 


But I didn’t even realize how fucked certain “minor” things were. Like being forced to wake up at 6 am when I got a cold or how I wasn’t allowed to even sleep during “reflection time” which was basically a 3 hour time out style punishment for breaking rules or trash talking the facility, or refusing to eat the expired food. They would take away all my things like books or drawing stuff- anything to occupy the time and I wasn’t allowed to sleep either. They would stand there and poke me telling me “no sleeping” every time I tried to sleep to pass the time.


I was at my weakest when I went there- because I was depressed with a bunch of mental illness but now I still feel so broken. I am angry and sad and I was talking to my grandma yesterday and she was appalled at the things I just thought were minorly shitty. I guess it puts it into perspective.

If my dog barks, which he never does, I tense up thinking he's outside the gate. But usually I can trick myself into sleeping. Be it a melatonin or ZQuil.

Last night was bad though. I haven't had a night like that in awhile. I tried smoking, I tried melatonin, I tried snuggling with my dog, and nothing helped. I did not get more than 10 minutes of sleep last night.

608;608;750_ptsd;"I don't know if I actually have ptsd TW: Sexual Trauma, suicide

I had what i think are repressed memories that came back about two years ago. I feel like i cant talk about my trauma, because i don't even know if it actually happened, or if my mind just made it up.

I've had a ridiculously high sex drive since late middle school for seemingly no reason, i was obsessed and so lost in fantasies (nothing immoral) that my grades fell. Im trans and poly, like so aggressively poly i have trouble with monogamous relationships. I have diagnosed chemical depression and general anxiety disorders but i thought it was common, especially in high school. I went to therapy but they would always try to figure out ""the real reason"" i was depressed, as though my litte sister passing wasn't enough. I attempted suicide several times, but nobody knew.

I had a sexual relationship with an ex my sophomore year. A few months after we started having sex, i started dissociating and having flashbacks of things i didn't remember, followed by panic attacks. I had had lots of negative sexual encounters (like regret or harassment; i often got my ass slapped in middle school hallways and thought it was a good thing until i was older) which, sadly, lots of afab people do, but i didn't remember any assault. 

I still have the flashbacks, though not as often or aggressively. Some positions or certain phrases trigger it, sometimes it's just the act, sometimes it's because someone angrily kicked their backpack in the hall or raised their voice. I usually have to stop whatever sexual thing I'm doing and often don't do anything else sex-wise for several days, but i can occasionally force it out of my head and continue. I still have an elevated sex drive but not as crazy as before i started getting them. I still have problems with monogamy.

I wonder if the sex drive and my being trans and poly were defense mechanisms, like subconsciously trying to retake control of my body. I guess I'll never really know. I've tried to tell therapists and counselors, but i can't ever spit it out because i feel like they'll tell me repressed memories are a myth or I'm doing it for attention and i just don't know what to do. My ex broke up with me partly because of it. I hate sex now but i love it and i can't just quit. I'm so tired and conflicted and i don't know what to do.

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married.  I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest.  It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored.  So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats.  He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside.  My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man.  And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then.  I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man.  

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen.  One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed.  Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up.  And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house.  

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year.  And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

820;820;1636_ptsd;"I don't know if this actually happened to me or not. I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

Pay attention to every single word and then assess in which way what they’re saying could be about me or directed at me. I get it in songs, tv, people, everything. I can’t turn it off. I feel like it pisses people off as well, like they notice that I am very aware of them if that makes any sense?

I was assaulted sexuallly and psychologically by a guy I used to be friends with. They used a drug on me called scopolamine, they said a bunch of things into my head while I was on it and its brainwashed me to an extent. That or it’s ptsd and I’ve completely lost my sanity, but I doubt it.";1

Luckily my juggler vein was not cut during the accident. I never lost conciousness. I was told during the 40 minutes of my stay inside of my car they weren't sure if my juggler  had been cut. I expected to die, thought of my mother and stayed strong. I never lost my cool. Some people screamed and said my ears were bleeding. My neck was stabilized by a nurse and doctor traveling behind me in transit ti my luck. It's been 5 years, my 6th year is October 21st 2019. I havent been able to work since 2017. I have realized after so many years that I have PTSD unfortunately. I own a property so I am able to repay my parents help/support and thank god for them.

Over a year ago, I got out of a relationship because he would always guilt me into doing sexual things I knew I didn't want to do. He'd say stuff like 'don't you trust me?' and I felt like it's what I needed to do to be a good partner. But after every time, I'd have to hide in my bathroom for a few minutes and calm myself down from a panic attack. I was and still am full of guilt from the situation and can barely think about it without feeling disgusting. For the most part, I've kind of willed myself to stop thinking about the details but I remain hyper vigilant and paranoid that he's watching me (we still live in the same city). I've always suffered from anxiety and depression but my list of triggers has almost doubled in size, but for the most part, I can function like a normal person. 

I've found it really hard recently to keep everything straight in my head, and the fact that I still have feelings for him makes it to where I can't even take myself seriously about what happened. Maybe it was my fault after all and I'm just over exaggerating. 

I can't seem to be mad at him for anything but the few people I've confided in seem to be pretty pissed. It doesn't make sense. ";1
480;480;411_ptsd;"I don't remember. I don't remember anything before I was about eight years-old. 
I remember an instance of walking past a Boston Pizza with my bio dad when I was about four, according to my mom this was the route he took me to the liquor store. 
I remember being left alone in a grocery store by him while he went to get alcohol.
I remember hearing glass breaking downstairs from my bedroom.
I remember watching my dad get arrested outside while I played with my puzzle and ate watermelon on the steps.
Most of these things I had accounted as dreams to the point of not knowing which memories were real or fake. 
For context, my dad was a heavy alcoholic and would beat my mom often, nearly killing her a couple of times. I've had to call the ambulance for him as an infant when he had a stroke. He is much better now, and I don't blame him for being ill at the time. But, I think I'm just now coming to terms with the fact that I've suffered trauma, twelve years after it happened. 
It really sucks. I don't have many nice memories of my childhood, and I didn't even know it was abnormal not to remember being a child until this year. 
I want to remember learning how to ride a bike or playing outside with my friends, but...There's really nothing there.";1

June 6, 2011 we were in Iraq when we got his by an IRAM (improvised rocket assisted mortar) attack, where they shot water heaters at us filled with 200lb of HME (homemade explosives). I went to the VA for help after a suicide attempt in February 2019. I checked myself into the loony bin about 18 hours after the suicide attempt and started (also finished) treatment.

It's been several months since and I started having bad dreams the last 2 weeks or so. I just woke up, not sure if it was a noise, the cat doing something, a dream, idk... I thought I was back in Iraq with a friend of mine who was in the shower when we got attacked and ended up decapitated. He died running naked to the bunker and ended up the result of a direct hit on the bunker. Was found with his head detached laying a few feet from his body still blinking and looking around with an extreme look of fear on his face.

In this dream, we started getting attacked and I told him to run for the bunker, then I ran the other way for a further bunker and I got knocked over and knocked out from percussion by the blast of when he got hit. That's when I woke up and I propped up out of bed, ran into the wall, stumbled and ran into the closet full bore and went face first into the wall in there. I fell over again and when I got back up I started coming to and noticed I was covered in blood, all over me, the clothes in the closet and all over the carpet.";1

220;220;1272_ptsd;"I don't want my partner to be near me when I need his help most. (semi vent?) I have PTSD to needles. I also have an anaphylactic allergy to most animals. I am terrified of my own Epi pen.  
Last time I had a major attack I fought tooth and nail while suffocating to not have an epi-pen used on me. Thankfully my regular doctor was there and he was brave enough to administer the drug into the oxygen that was being pumped into my throat - a less effective treatment that could have gotten him into trouble.   
My partner looks after my epi-pen at home and has warned me that if I have another attack he will use it on me. This is hard, just remembering its in the house somewhere gives me stress, but the worst thing is the thought of him being there when I'm suffering.

The thing I am scared of is associating *him* with my fear. I don't want to loose trust of my partner. I've lost trust of being in the car with my mother if I don't know exactly where we are going, I've lost trust of entering buildings I'm not familiar with beforehand. I don't want to be unable to trust someone I've shared a life with for 5 years.  
I've told him that if I ever need a needle for any reason I don't want him in the room. I don't want him near me. I'd rather he run away and leave me alone with strangers than stay by my side to try and help.  
Does anyone else have similar problems to this? Is that the wrong thing to expect from him?   
I can't convince him to not use an epipen on me to save my life, he's not going to let me die if a dog touches me, but... I don't know what to do about that. It's hard to think about for long. I feel conflicted.";0

and I have PTSD

I was diagnosed last year, and honest to god, I didn't process any of it. A few months earlier than my PTSD diagnosis, I was diagnosed with GAD, and the two seem a world apart.

I just need to get this off my chest.

As the second anniversary of the goddamn event that screwed my brain over approaches quickly, I've been falling into trap after trap with my PTSD. My triggers are the smallest, dumbest, most random ass things that no one would think are triggers. The most inconspicuous things just sets me straight into a panic attack. I try and smile through them but I'm struggling. I hate that these are my triggers. I don't dislike any of them, I want to normalize them, but I can't do that when I feel like I'm going to pass out every time I encounter them.

I recently experienced sleep paralysis for the first time. And I didn't see some ungodly demon standing in the corner of my room or an old hag sitting on me, quite frankly I'd rather see them. I couldn't open my eyes, I was just paralysed, every inch of my body felt like lead, and all I felt was the sensations of the event and the sheer horror that ran through me as I refused to even attempt to open my eyes in fear that I'd come face to face with it.

I'm losing sleep. I see movement out of the corner of my eyes and dark shadows in places where no one else sees them. I can't focus, my anxiety is wearing me down and my brain just slowly works its way back to what happened every time I try to shove it to the farthest reaches of my subconscious.

Its frustrating that I can't find stories or accounts of others around my age experiencing the same things. Teenage PTSD is so stigmatized its actually dangerous. Apart from the occasional 'coming out of foster care' story, I don't find things I can relate to. I guess it makes sense. Teenaged girls don't have PTSD, it just doesn't happen, but I'm living proof that it does, and it feels to me like I'm alone in that. I haven't been in foster care or an orphanage, I haven't been in a war, my event seems inconsequential in the face of all that. I feel alone. I can't find others like me. Its wearing me down, and I'm afraid. I'm afraid I'll have to live my life knowing that.";0

129;129;508_ptsd;I feel invalid Hi everyone. Long read ahead, sorry. I’m really new to asking for advice let alone posting things like this in general. to get to the point, i feel like i don’t deserve to call myself a PTSD sufferer and i’m often embarrassed to tell people i have it because they’ll either think i’m lying or exaggerating. i’ve had several concussions, one of them a freak accident (a foul baseball from another field came up over the fence and hit me in the back of the head while i was in the dugout) that left me in an almost vegetative stage for a few months and i still suffer the mental and cognitive consequences today. it’s gotten so bad to where i can’t play softball (my favorite sport) or go to baseball games with my dad (which we always used to do) because i become so afraid whenever i hear a ball hit a bat that i shut down and have several panic attacks in a row. I have the same reaction whenever something comes near my head, even when my friend threw a napkin in my direction.  am i valid for feeling this way? i genuinely feel so stupid and emotional for having these reactions even though my psychiatrist told me that’s normal for people with PTSD.  has anyone else felt this way? what should i do about the people that almost scoff at me once i tell them *why* i have PTSD? thank you so much in advance i appreciate it.;0
326;326;639_ptsd;"I feel like a fake and like my PTSD is not valid. (Sexual assault trigger warning) Writing this on my phone and it's hard to tell how  much I am actually writing. Sorry if it's super long.

TL;DR History of sexual assault. I feeI like a fake because people have had it so much worse than me and yet my ptsd runs my life. Feel embarrassed by my lack of experience with men which is a consequence of PTSD.

I have struggled with this for a long time and I have avoided posting about it because I have been afraid of people confirming these feelings. I have been on medication prescribed to me for PTSD for a few years now and this has been my only way of allowing myself to feel valid. I don't tell people about my PTSD but when I have to I feel like I need to somehow slip the fact that I am medicated into the disclosure so that I will be taken seriously. When I say ""have to"" I am referring to situations such as the time I signed up for a self defense class and I needed them to know not to get on top of me in any way (will make sense later) and that I needed a female teacher. I needed to mention the PTSD for context. 

A little background: I have always had a fear of men and I can't really pinpoint when it started or why, but it was always more severe than the unfortunately common intimidation that many women tend to feel. I remember feeling this way as early as 7 or 8. I would avoid men in general. Experiences such as being cat called and followed in my early teens made it worse. 

The experience which really caused my PTSD happened just after i moved away from home for college. I was at a friends house one night and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up in the middle of the night with a guy 'friend' straddling me and giving me hickeys and trying to take off my clothing. I told him to get off me multiple times and he didn't. I curled up into a fetal position until he gave up and left. It felt like he was on top of me for hours but I'm guessing it was more like 15 or 20 minutes. Nothing more happened, he got off me and fell asleep somewhere in the apartment, but it left me anxious and depressed for months.  I felt dirty and guilty. I couldn't look men in the eyes and any romantic attention from men felt even more threatening than it did for me already, even if I knew that they were probably very nice guys. Because of this I have never had a boyfriend. Never slept with a man. The first and last time I had sexual contact with a man was when I woke up to someone who I thought I could trust sucking on my neck and putting his hand under my blanket. I am nearly 25 now. Its embarrassing to me and I am afraid that, at this point, if I manage to move past the anxiety of male attention that I will scare away any man with my lack of experience.

That was the first one. The second event, which blew everything up, was when I was jumped walking home at night. I am a runner and a lot stronger than I look as a small woman and managed to get away. It left me so traumatized, though, because I tried really hard to get help and no one would help me. The security guard at my apartment building told me to stop talking and tell the female security guard who was only going to be working 4 days later, and the police laughed at me when I described what happened. (Might sound unlikely but I was living in another country at this time and this isnt uncommon behavior there).

At this point I would physically start to shake if I was hanging out with a man and he got touchy. Panic attack symptoms minus hyperventilation. 
I would feel my body go cold and my muscles seize up. There was a situation when I was trying to get over this all and had been on a few dates with a guy. He kissed me and all was fine until he touched my thigh and I started having a panic attack. I was so embarrassed and humiliated because he immediately left the room to tell him roommates. Yes, I know, I found myself an asshole.

That left me with really unhealthy views of men (even more than before) and I genuinely believed for a very long time that men did not feel love and that any appearance of love was purely a form of manipulation. These experiences along with an unfortunate mother (who would tell me things like ""all men cheat"") caused me to be so scared to fall in love because to me that would mean being a slave. It took me a very long time to realise that men do feel love. People will probably be wondering this: my father is in my life and he is a good man. One of the most honest and loving people I know. No issues there.

Anyway, here I am years later. I have been through therapy, take antianxiety/antidepressants and have managed to cut down my PTSD meds to ""as needed"". So, Prazosin when I have nightmares, and that's all. I still get incredibly uncomfortable with men touching me and i am terrified of sex and it stops me from pursuing men I like. I am so worried that they will not be patient with me and that i am embarrassing. 

It's also hard to know when to bring this up with a man because I dont want to scare him off but at the same time I dont want him to scare me off by going at a pace I cant handle. 

To bring it back to my post title....I feel like a fraud. There are women who have been through experiences infinitely worse than mine and yet here I am complaining about it. It's so hard to like life. I really dont like life right now.";1
1025;1025;1441_ptsd;"I feel like anytime I open up to someone about my PTSD, I scare them off. So today was my second day at my new job (I'm a barista at Starbucks). This is the first time in 3 ish months that I've worked. I got fired at my last job because I had to go to inpatient in June and I couldn't show up to work. When I got back from inpatient, I wanted to talk to the HR lady to see where I stand with my job. Considering I didn't have a choice in my hospitalization, I thought it would be fine. Well, it wasn't fine. She didn't even talk to me in private, she just fired me in the lobby in front of people. It triggered me so hard, I just gave up on trying. 

Fast forward to now, I'm feeling really good about life. I still struggle, but I can sorta manage it. But it's difficult for me to get back into the working mindset. I'm so scatterbrained, I can't focus, I dissociate all the time. It's exhausting. Plus I'm CS (customer support) so every 15 minutes I have to brew coffee and make customer connections (talk and interact with them). IT IS KILLING ME. I'm so awkward, and I can't seem to get a grip on anything. It's a continuous cycle of me not being able to focus, so it stresses me out, which makes me dissociate, which makes me try to focus even harder. So on and so forth. 

My coworkers are very supportive of me, but I don't think most of them understand what PTSD is. I always get a uncomfortable vibe once I tell someone about my diagnosis. It was super uncomfortable my first day because another guy who started the same day as me (who btw, I met at partial of all places) ASKED ME IN FRONT OF MY MANAGER WHAT MY DIAGNOSES WERE. I felt like I was outed. It makes me cringe when I think of that moment. I'm trying to be positive, but it's really hard to at the moment.";0

title kind of explains it all but here's my story. yesterday i was at pride for the first time ever. my parents aren't all that supportive of the LGBT community so it took me years to find the courage to go. we were one block over from the main event because we wanted to get food and suddenly a guy runs by and yells ""don't go that way"" but we don't see anything so we keep walking and suddenly a flood of people is running towards us and yelling ""RUN"" so we start running and we get caught in this stampede and there's people falling and tripping and suddenly i hear a loud noise and i've grown up around guns so i don't really scare easy but this sounded exactly like a gun shot and i've never run faster in my life and then we're ushered into this building and there's maybe fifty people crammed in and people including adults are crying and holding their kids, people are praying, people are calling their loved ones. i called my mom and had to tell her i loved her and that i was safe but i didn't know what was happening and to tell my dad too because he was on a plane to india and i din't even get to say goodbye to him because i left before he went to the airport and then my friend and i just kinda took charge because nobody else was and we didn't know what was going on. i have no regard for my personal safety so i ran outside to find a cop and all i hear is ""gun in custody, no dead, people injured"" so as i'm running back into the building a second wave of people starts running and i barely make it back into the building before getting trampled and there's even more people and two girls are having massive panic attacks and there was no cell service and the news wasn't updating on anything so we didn't have any information on what was happening and nobody would say anything and there were a bunch of cops outside but for an hour we were in a complete communications blackout and i thought there was a shooter and i was going to die. when i got home and i was in service i found out that there was a fight and somebody whipped out a gun and chaos ensued. i really didn't feel anything while it was happening. my hands weren't shaking at all and when i got home i couldn't even cry but today i was at the pool and walking in and outside there was chalk on the ground that said ""RUN"" and my stomach immediately dropped for no real reason and then inside there were people playing water polo and they missed the goal and the ball made the same sound i heard when i was running yesterday and after i left i got in my car and i just started crying for ten minutes. afterwards i was out with my friend and some kids ran past us and again my stomach just dropped and i was back in that moment. we saw a movie and this guy kept walking in and out of the theater and all i could think about was how there was nowhere to hide. 

&amp;#x200B;

that's my story. i feel like i'm just overreacting because there wasn't actually a shooter and so many other people actually have lived through shootings so in comparison this was nothing. i just don't know how to feel about all of this. i'm alternating between feeling absolutely nothing, like now as i'm typing this, and complete anxiety and crying. i know i should talk to a therapist but there's none covered by insurance in my area and my old therapist was really expensive. i'll have access to a counselor for free in college but i don't know if i can live like this for the next two months if every loud noise or sound of people running makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry and with all of this shame because i feel like i shouldn't be this affected by something that wasn't really even a real threat in the end. i didn't know where else to go and i don't know what to do.";1

I was having a major panic attack and I tried to tell a girl from my school I was too freaked out to go back to the school and she said I was overreacting and looked at me like I was crazy. Since time has passed I feel like I am coping better with my PTSD but it just sucks when you feel like your feelings aren't valid.";1
109;109;413_ptsd;"I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**



**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7"" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2"" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.

Fast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  

Another episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.

I know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.

Sorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.

**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**

826;826;2173_ptsd;"I feel so stuck right now I'm still trying to understand trauma and how it's affected me (started when I was really young and lasted 25 years, I'm now almost 27), so I was hoping someone could help me parse out what's happening. I feel like I don't even have the right language to describe it. 

- I'm spaced out at work and am lucky to get a few things done, so out of an 8-hour work day it feels like I work for one or two hours which I feel terrible about. I work off-site so I'm by myself most of the time. Dissociation or just lack of concentration?
- I'm afraid to see people at work that I know (it does happen once or twice a day) because I'm afraid they'll see how spaced out or freaked out I look. 
- I can barely handle my husband touching me, even as a hug
- Even when nothing is wrong it feels like I'm in terrible danger 
- The fight/flight/freeze part of my brain that supposed to be working in the background is constantly at the forefront, and the active thinking/listening/cognitive processing part feels like it's slowly trying to catch up. It's like my brain reversed itself.
- Things keep randomly reminding me of the trauma and then I feel upset or confused or spaced out for a while--is this a flashback or what?? Sometimes it's visual (I get a mental picture of the scary person walking down the street that lasts for a split second), sometimes it's a smell, sometimes it feels just like a memory of something bad that leaves me feeling upset?
- Last Friday I got to the point where it took every bit of energy to just not collapse on the subway, to not scream when I got startled that someone got on the subway, it felt like my legs were floating when they were firmly on the floor, everything sounded like it was distant and far away and nothing felt real. 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I'm just so overwhelmed and my supervisor has noticed but has been really kind about it. I feel like things are getting worse and I need to keep my job. ";0

308;308;698_ptsd;"I finally told my mom the other day. I've known I have PTSD of abandonment since early September of last year, but I just very recently worked up the courage to let my mom know.

I don't fully know why I was so reluctant to let her know. I think it was partially fear of being judged, and partially a worry that her knowing that I have PTSD would make her feel bad; she did everything she could for me growing up, and watching me after my dad left and then again when my sister left was very hard on her. 

I'm a very private person, and now that she knows, I'm not 100% sure how I feel about it (the only reason I even feel okay posting here is because it's anonymous! haha). She took it pretty well - so I suppose I should chalk it up to a success. 

Should I go about telling other people now? Is it necessary, or to my benefit? Or am I better off with people not knowing?

635;635;739_ptsd;"I freaked out over a birthday gift. Can books be triggering? Two years ago my boyfriend gave me a play that means a lot to him. He said a lot of it reminds him of me, but the thing is, a lot of the play has to do with mental illness. 

I do have PTSD, and it was a lot worse then than it is now, but I never wanted to define myself by it. I did hallucinate sometimes, and when it got really bad I'd even hide under the table, but I'm not proud of those moments, and it's much easier to deal with life if I move on and try not to think about how crazy I look while having a flashback. 

So it was pretty upsetting to realise that maybe he sees me primarily as someone who is mentally ill. It doesn't help that the character who reminds him of me is told to shut up and quit whining. But my boyfriend wasn't comfortable with me giving it away, saying that someday he'd like his own copy. So I kept it for two years and tried not to think about it. 

Yesterday we took everything off the bookshelves, and as soon as I saw the play, all those old feelings came back. I felt as if giving me this play was a message that I don't hate myself enough. That character was like a caricature of me at my worst moments, and as I'm recovering pretty well, I'd like to put that behind me. I tried to give the play to my boyfriend, but he looked sad and insisted that it was a gift from him to me. 

He explained that the play was so special that he didn't even show it to some of his best friends. He thought it was one of the most thoughtful gifts possible, from anyone, and that he believed I was clever enough to appreciate it as he does. Also, when I saw myself in that character, I'd realise that all my painful thoughts are just words, and then they'll stop hurting me. And lastly, he told me to get rid of the play, but after hearing all this, I feel so guilty and absolutely despise myself. 

All the same, there were lines like ""You can only kill yourself if you're not already dead"" and ""No one can hate me more than I hate myself"". The author was someone who lived with pain and was used to it, and she did commit suicide. I was going to counselling in order to stop feeling suicidal. I was trying to do anything possible not to be mentally ill, and this gift felt like a slap in the face. It still does, but I wonder, is my feeling justified at all? Am I terribly ungrateful and dramatic about this?";0
227;227;396_ptsd;"I got called the name of my abuser. Help. My father abused me my entire life. I watched him break my mom’s ribs. I watch him throw my brother. He grabbed me by my throat. He would kick and hit me. He mentally abused me. He told me I wasn’t worth anything. I was fat. I wasn’t pretty. He put my life in danger a few times.

He abused me. I’m still recovering. I still have nightmares. I still have issues with everything in life. With life itself.

And today I got called by his name. I can’t stop crying. I feel nothing. I feel like I should die. I wish he would die and if I’m like him, then I should die.

843;843;1581_ptsd;"I guess there could be someone who can relate? Well I’ll try and keep it to the point, I’m a veteran who was diagnosed with PTSD in 2012 post Afghanistan , I also received a moderate traumatic brain injury and suffered hearing loss for which I use hearing aids and also severe tinnitus. Been self medicating over the years, a lot of dark spots, a lot of violence, confusion and  no understanding of how I am still here. There has been some extremely low parts for me, but there is also a big positive, I’m married with two lovely kids. Which is the main thing pushing me on, trying to get control of my conditions.
Apart from the endless list of medication, (sertraline, mirtazapine, olanzapine, pregablin and diazepam) There hasn’t been much in the way of actually receiving help. I hold it down until I explode, reach out for help just to get knocked down. I live in a place where I can’t talk about my background because the military is not respected or wanted, in fact hated. I can’t hold down a job, I can’t remember large sections of my life. I can’t drive, move around too quickly or do things that are considered normal activities. My hearing, memory and balance are getting progressively worse, I have near constant pins and needles in my hands and feet, my grip is getting weaker by the day. It’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel but it’s right in front of me, my family and I want to get as well as I can, to be the man I know I can be for them.

I’ve never told anyone about what he did to me. It wasn’t the first time I was molested. It wasn’t the last either. But it was the most impactful because he’s the only “father” figure I’ve had in my life. I feel so in shock I guess.

1020;1020;2662_ptsd;"I had a new traumatic experience that set me way back in my recovery. I had a really abusive childhood, and I have been doing well, therapy and so on, getting better, then I  had a new traumatic experience In the hospital that involved really mean nurses, it was like a remix of all my ptsd nightmares brought to life, and now I’m scared of everything. There is a marked lack of compassion from everyone because I had been at an event and had too much to drink. (Which is not a frequent thing for me) I don’t really have a substance issue. Never have. But yes, I drank too much that night. 

So I was drunk, rather drunk, but that doesn’t make me a garbage human who deserves to be terrorized by sadistic nurses for hours. I am so haunted by my experience. I can’t sleep, I have been vomiting a lot, I keep hearing noises, and having dreams about my abuser, and everyone in my life seems to think I should just be able to shrug it off. I’m really traumatized by the experience. Im scared all the time. And I don’t know what to do. 
All my other trauma was long running, chronic every day abuse from a cruel parent figure, I’ve never experienced an isolated individual deeply disturbing event like this before. I have exactly zero ability to handle it. I just keep replaying the experience over and over and I want to make myself feel safe and strong again.

980;980;2436_ptsd;"I had a panic attack and felt like it led me into a flashback and I don't know if I responded properly. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety since the last three years, and I couldn't get any medical help as my parents said they ""don't believe in mental diseases"" and only recently, as I managed to get some professional help, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and insomnia, and this was about two months back.

I have always felt that my symptoms more or less would be better diagnosed as PTSD. I have been in taking medication for the last few months.

I have been having panic attacks since the last three years, with varied intensity, although avoiding triggers have been helpful. When they are very intense, I kinda seem to go into this flashback where I feel as if I am in a past event of my life and things are repeating themselves. As could be understood, my body tries to prevent this by going into a state of panic before and all this combined with the anxiety of panic attacks and my past and all those memories make my life so much harder and deteriorate the quality of living to very substantial levels. 

A couple of days back, something triggered me and I was about to have a panic attack. As I was on medication, I was able to let it happen, and soon, I was in this flashback which related to the times where I was little and my parents used to abuse me physically. They used to beat me, for invalid reasons, for trying to take their angry out, or express their emotions. And suddenly, I understood what was going wrong. I was afraid. I was afraid, that they would kill me, and I won't be able to stop them or do anything, and this was the same feeling as 10-12 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

But this time, I did something different. When I was in the flashback, I.... I stopped my dad. I grabbed the stick he was using to beat, and I tried to stop him. But he wouldn't. He tried to hurt me again, but then, in order to defend myself, I had to hurt him. But even then he wouldn't stop. So I kept hurting him, and I started feeling better and secure. It was as if the fear was going away and no one could harm me. But then my mum comes in the picture and she starts hurting me, and I did the same.

&amp;#x200B;

As I found myself being safe, I was able to control myself, and breathe properly, and the thing ended. I still had my mind numb for a while, as usually happens with my panic attacks, but I felt better.

Am I okay? Can you please give me your opinion on this? Thanks for reading.";0
1152;1152;1981_ptsd;I had a serious traffic accident in May and my psychotherapist found I have ptsd and several triggers regarding cars and traffic. My friends don’t stop making fun of the accident though.. I happened several times since then. They think that just because I didn‘t have any fractures or other physical damage, I‘m fine. They continue to crack jokes concerning my driving now and my car back then and my new one. I tend to get really angry and yell at them but they don’t understand.

429;429;919_ptsd;"I had my first EMDR session and my thoughts are... Game-changer. Absolute game-changer. I'm 28 and have been doing talk therapy on and off since I was 9 years old and would say it's helped about 15-20%, definitely SOMETHING and am grateful for all of my therapists. But it left me feeling as though I was simply managing a lot of deeply entwined problems and not actually healing them. I really felt like I didn't have much to show for almost two decades. 

My current therapist recommended EMDR and helped me to stop trivializing my childhood traumas. I did what a lot of us do and didn't think that my traumas weren't ""severe enough"" to be treated as PTSD. 

I am a highly functioning trauma victim/survivor with a solid good-paying career, yet, I felt like I was being eaten alive from the inside by cannibals, on a daily basis. But you know, because I could hold down a job, I was obviously unworthy of actual trauma-treatment, (makes sense, right?).  

My first EMDR session the other day impacted me more around 85% - 90% as opposed to the normal 15 - 20% I mentioned earlier. We still have several sessions to go, but I am very excited for them and I don't plan on quitting talk therapy after we're done. 

Again, this is a big big deal. I was pouring tears of joy by the end of it and it seems like I'm finally setting my fucked up, mangled, brain in a cast so it can heal. Someone else I read on here compared PTSD to a poison flowing through our bodies, and I feel like I am finally extracting it. Good luck, and I love you all.";0

44;44;17_ptsd;"I had the worst experience today (TW) So I have complex ptsd from a whole range of stuff including sex abuse and stuff. I’ve changed some details to protect myself. 

Anyway so I used to know this guy and he was like my music teacher and I always saw him as a fatherly figure since I was like 13 at the time and home wasn’t great. He’s always look after me and I felt safe with him. 
So fast forward to now where I’m mid twenties and my music teacher messages me on fb asking for a catch up and I was like sure why not! Seems innocent enough. So anyway we are at this cafe and just catching up and half way through the conversation he starts talking about the reason he stopped teaching music was because he was kicked out because one of his students (16yo) had accused him of having sex with her and he had housed her for many nights in a house with only 30yo men because she had been kicked out and that he took her to his house late at night and she just stayed there. So he got kicked out and his girlfriend left him. And at the time of him telling me this I started to feel really sick to my stomach, and then he does something completely unexpected and start talking about this cheeky slightly lewd photo I had posted and how I had grown into such a beautiful woman and how I should feel good about myself because I’m sexy. 
And so I finish the conversation and go home. I couldn’t shake this feeling of just feeling yucky and gross and used and ashamed and embarrassed.  I kept thinking why did he say that? He’s supposed to be my friend, why did he make it weird? I kinda just wanna curl into a ball and cry and I don’t know why. Like it’s not a big deal but maybe if I had done something differently he wouldn’t have said that? I just can’t get over it and I don’t know why. Maybe I’m just overreacting. But it’s really made me feel awful and confused.

I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts. I lied to my friends and said that I got my black eye from work. I remember one time specifically was at AWA, and all of my friends that were there, surrounded me and wouldn't leave me alone about my black eye, which wasn't the first one. I lied to them again and then I told them I had to pee, and went to the bathroom and cried really hard. Fast forward to the end, a couple of years ago. I had a concussion at work. I fell into a running compactor and hit my head, and my boss saved my life. I completely forgot the previous two months, including my sister getting engaged and everything. They wouldn't let me drive or watch movies or anything until I recovered. It was a nightmare. Well I started getting my memory back and she started a fight with me because my friend was coming to see me and she ""wanted to do her workout."" it escaladed very quickly to the same routine as before only this time I broke a statue that we got together and I threw the flowers I got her on the floor and the cops were called again and said one of us had to leave for the night. She kicked me out and broke up with me and never let me come back. I couldn't drive at the time she made me stay outside until my mom came and got me. I begged her not to do it, because I was in love with her despite everything and she treated me like a criminal and condemned me. She tried to turn all of my friends against me (which failed horribly for the most part) and told everyone that I was the one abusing her. I never touched her like that and I never said anything so horrible to her. I treated her like gold 95% of the time and I cared about her more than anything. I left her a long letter on the porch a week after all of this, explaining how much she meant to me and that I wanted a new start with her and she called the cops to tell me to leave her alone and told everyone that I was a psycho. It keeps coming back to haunt me every so often, how do I cope? ";1

539;539;1202_ptsd;I just don't know what to do, mostly just a vent post, but if you think there's something that can help I'm all ears Honestly theres probably nothing anyone could say that could help (although your more than welcome to try, I will always appreciate support) but I've been on meds to treat my PTSD for about a year now and about 6 months for the medication i'm on now, and its working so well, I've honestly never been this happy in my entire life. However, I'm studying abroad in france for this semester and I'm about to run out of this medication, and I cant get anyone to prescribe me a medication I feel comfortable taking, so I may just have to go off my meds. In france it seems that doctors just automatically want to give you xanex for anything anxiety related, obviously I dont think theres anything wrong with taking Xanex in general, if it helps someone thats great but since I have been taking a non-addictive medication in the states that has worked wonders, and my US doctor has made it clear she doesn't like prescribing Xanex unless nothing else works I'm incredibly uncomfortable with it. I have now been going to doctors appointments for a month now trying to get something I can take (I've taken SSRI's before, and while they still leave me with way too many mental illness symptoms, the worst of them are gone), and of the 5 different doctors appointments I've had all have been really against prescribing me anything other than  Xanex. Im honestly just so scared, the last time I went off medications I failed every assignment I had during that time period, and spent almost every second of my day in bed feeling like crap, and this time, since I'm abroad I don't even have friends that I can reach out to in person, just through text for the second half of the day, thanks to the time difference. I've already noticed my mental health getting significantly worse just from the stressed cause by all this. I'm just so worried, and I know the worry is just going to make everything worse, because even though i'm medicated right now its making me miserable, so I'm going to crash fast and of course I'm going to dun out right in the middle of midterm week. Anyways thanks for reading all this, I just needed to get it out somewhere and I didn't know where else to go. ;0

It's like I'm simultaneously trying to avoid it and think about it. I feel like I got left behind in my initial trauma and then time just kept progressing without me when that happened, and now this has happened it's the same thing where I'm just stuk in the moments before it happened onstantly trying to understand why anything ould have happened after that that wasn't aording to my plan that I'd now onvined myself would keep going and just what the fuk happened and until I understand all of these things in my life now I don't give a SHIT about and I also everytime I remember...

I think I feel bad about it (no offense), I get sorta... upset with myself because I don’t really want to have all these problems, I’m just 15. We haven’t decided on medications yet, and its just sorta weird to be going through all these processes and all these people looking at me and just seeing whats wrong, and not seeing me. Then you have the constant bombardment of my parents asking me about things he mentioned, and saying that if I ate better, or slept more, I’d be fine. Which is sorta ironic because the psychiatrist told my mom that while those things can be factors, its really not this time. I don’t really blame her though, she called PTSD, PSTD, and most of the time just calls me angsty. I just don’t really know what to feel about the whole diagnosis. ";0

I ignored this fact, or told myself that it wasn't that bad, for the last 17ish years.  Within the last year, I've admitted to myself that I lived through very traumatic events and I started pursuing professional help.  My PCP originally diagnosed me with GAD, prescribed medication, and suggested I start seeing a therapist. After several sessions, my therapist has diagnosed me with PTSD and has suggested a therapist that specializes in Cognitive Processing Therapy.  She's suggested that I do this in conjunction with our sessions, or at the very least, pick our sessions back up at the end of the 12 week timeframe for the CPT therapist. 

Until today, I wasn't familiar with this type of therapy.  After looking into it.

I've had episodes for a while now, on and off. Bad nightmares. Visceral nightmares. I'd go into detail but I'm trying not to trigger anyone.

Then I started getting flashbacks. My sister used to attack me. She used to choke me, drown me, and physically attack me. My mother assaulted me a few times when I was very little, and gave me a really bad scare when I was a young teen. My father would go on rampages that I was always terrified would escalate to violence but rarely did. 

Two weeks ago, I had... an episode. Something I haven't had in that severity since 2008. My fiancee made a comment like my father would have made, before he would force an intense cleaning episode where he screamed at me for an hour while I cleaned as fast as possible while crying. I don't fully remember all of what happened, but I threw money at her, told her I was a worthless piece of shit, did all of the chores I could manage (made myself sick while doing so) and then climbed under the bed to cry. 

It was... intense.

403;403;427_ptsd;"I need advice (Trigger warning) TW: CSA and death

I haven’t been offically diagnosed with PTSD or even know where or who can give me an offical diagnosis, but I’ve read posts on here and can relate to some...

Is it possible to have PTSD from being a CSA survivor and seeing my mom dead? 

I’m a CSA survivor, the abuser being my biological grandfather on my late mom’s side of the family. The abuse (molested) started in preschool and didn’t stop until December 2015 or 2016. 

In addition to being a CSA survivor, I lost my mom May 30th, 2019. She had multiple health issues before my brother and I were born and got worse over the last 10 years. For reference my brother was born in July 1998 and I was born in February 2000. Anyways, I had a dream I watched her die of a heart attack and sure enough 3 days later she died, most likely of a heart attack. My dad and I had gone to the store and when we got back she was face down on the floor, next to her bed. We had only been out for 40-50 minutes. I had my brother call 911 while I took our dogs in my room so the paramedics could do their thing. I knew she was gone soon as I saw her body. After I don’t know how much time passed she was declared dead. I still had to stay with the dogs because of the medical examiners and funeral home people, so after some more time passed we shut the door to my parents room so I could talk with our pastor and cry with my family. Soon as I saw the foot of the body bag I walked to my room with my back turned to it. I didn’t want to see her get rolled out... but just when I thought the funeral people had already taken her outside, I turned around. It was a mistake. I saw her face in the body bag as they rolled her out and no matter how much everything told me to look away, I couldn’t. 

Ever since then I’ve had countless dreams where I see her die, see my friends go missing and/or end up dead, and see my dad die. I also experience flashbacks that replay the scene of the night she died. I also have flashbacks to when I was molested even though it’s been almost 3 years since it stopped. I don’t know what’s wrong with me because when the flashbacks start, they don’t stop.";1

So.. this is mostly me sharing my story in a community of seemingly supportive people and then posing a question at the end.

To start, I'm a trans man and the events I'm discussing all occured when I identified as female, as a child. 
As all kids do, my sister and I would play pretend. She's about 2 years older than me, and we were always very nerdy, we would play as star trek characters or something and run around outside, sometimes we'd play as Mario characters. I was the younger sibling so I'd always get stuck playing the boy bc sis wanted to play as a girl. Eventually the Mario playing turned sexual, but here's the thing, we never actually touched each other, it would always be one of us just sitting on the other and stuff like that. It's very rare for me to remember things that happened to me when I was a child because of how badly I was bullied and beaten in school. (A kid damaged my eye so badly that my vision is damaged for life and I have to wear glasses.) This leads me to believe u have ptsd because I block out like all of school from my memories. Anyway, the events with sis went on until I was probably 12 or 13, her being 14-16. I'm 16 now and I can't imagine thinking its acceptable to play with a kid in that way. To describe it better it basically turned into roleplaying. We would act out sex with the motions and sounds but never actually do more than grind basically. Can someone please help? Should I get therapy? Was it rape? Would this contribute if I did have trauma and now developed ptsd? Thank you for reading.";1

I was there for 2 weeks after school helping . 

Last night I was driving off the clock and was right infront of a roll over crash . Girl ran a red light and guy had the right away. He flipped 3 times and watching it was like out of a movie. I ran up with a tryna kit I keep in the car and he was stuck in the truck. I had to break through his windshield to get him out . 

After 2 minutes I got in and pulled him out . He had glass in his face and blood was Everywhere. Looking at him I realized I went to school with him and he was my teachers kid. I layed him down and looked for DNR signs (do not resuscitate) and he didn't have any so I proceeded to begin CPR. He woke up to tell me to call his dad and as I called the EMT came in to get him.  .

He did not make it. The lady was under the influence. I feel so ashamed when I was in the class and the teacher wasn't there . I cried in class and feel guilty that I couldn't save him . Hunter I'm so sorry buddy.

552;552;1033_ptsd;"I recently started dating someone who brought something to my attention. Okay so it’s completely fine if nobody reads this or responds. I just need to put it out in the world somewhere. 

Here some background. My biodad is a narcissistic sociopath. He is incredibly abusive. Emotionally and mentally, and has not done anything physically but I think he would be capable of it. 

I have a chronic illness and was undiagnosed for a very long time. He thought I was lying. So he wouldn’t let me ice me joint and would tell me I was weak. Eventually I believed him. I still do to an extent. There are numerous other abusive things that would happen. 

But I never considered myself a trauma victim. I already thought “everyone else has it worse”. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I do have a therapist, but I never told him about any of the stuff with my biodad. I had convinced myself that I was over reacting and everything was fine. 

Recently, right before lockdown I met this great guy. I have issues around men (not I’m realizing it’s because my biodad always intimidated me) so I told him that before we started dating. He was really sweet about it. I explained that if he yelled I would completely break down and if we have an argument, it wouldn’t help. Our relationship has progressed and one night I was really having an awful night. 

Couldn’t sleep and I had some really bad flashback like nightmares. He called me and we chatted on the phone for a bit. After talking and me apologizing for talking about stuff. I said “I don’t get why it effects me. It’s not like I was abused. I wasn’t traumatized” and he said “I think you were. You’re having a trauma response and you deserve help. You deserve to be able to tell people. He hurt you really badly and you’re allowed to not feel okay”

And then it all kinda clicked? I realized that I was badly hurt and by not telling my therapist, I was just helping my biodad win. 

I have a FaceTime appointment with my theorist tomorrow. I’m mildly terrified. I’m so scared that he’s going to be mad at me.

94;94;227_ptsd;"I reflexively calmed down after my anger flared up for the first time today. TW: violence

For almost 3 years now I've been struggling with a PTSD that I got from being assaulted in public twice in a row in the span of 2 months. Since this was pretty public and the public was very apathetic to it it caused me to feel very worthless. I felt a lot of resentment for other people. Since then I've had anger issues. I got pretty good at hiding this though. 

&amp;#x200B;

In these last 3 years violence has played a big part in my routine mental thought. If I was mad at someone, even for the slightest smallest ""infractions"" towards me, I would fantasize about hurting them in some way. Life was mostly good, but I'd spent hours pacing around my apartment thinking about how people had ""crossed"" me that day, and how they were going to pay for it. It is really scary stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until today I always had to put in concious effort to stop when I caught myself having these involuntary fantasies. But today, for the first time, I caught myself in a fantasy and reflexively got myself out of it. It almost feels like my body finally realizes that I don't actually live a violent life, and that I can tackle my problems in other, healthier ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned to function with my PTSD for a long time now (therapy yay!), but this feels like the biggest step towards recovery yet. I really hope this trend continues, because sometimes I'm still afraid that one day I might slip up, and do something that I would regret. Luckily that hasn't happened yet, and things seem to get easier with time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you folks ever felt like they where ""stuck"" in a violent state of mind? How do you guys cope with it?  Are you guys hopeful for a full recovery or do you believe that PTSD is something you have to learn to live with? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Anger issues due to PTSD for long time, it feels like they're getting less.";1
28;28;128_ptsd;I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school.  I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store.  I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge.  When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it.  Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt.  i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back.  After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have.  I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there.  I dont remember much after that, it hurt.  10 years old.  Birthday party argument.  She pulled my hair, slapped me at home.  I cried.  11,12,13 years old.  It all got increasingly worse.  Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass.  I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it.  I still feel this way.  14 and 15 were the same.  All throughout the year, months, weeks, days.  More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling.  In my face, i couldn't get away.  Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped.  I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read.  Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed.  I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao).  I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14.  I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms).  I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry.;1
1033;1033;1810_ptsd;"I set myself back by thinking I could ask for help. And back to square 1 now... I was diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, Depression etc, etc after I came out of a coma from a failed suicide attempt in 2014. Many things/instances led me down the path I am currently on... childhood abuse (physical, sexual, mental) onto a lifetime of abuses (again physical, sexual, mental) and other tragedies mixed in like the death of my daughter...

Well, onto my current issue.. I had deactivated Facebook when I got out of the hospital. Besides that my memory was mush, people on that account had known what was occurring, contributed to or even blamed me for ""letting myself be tortured "". So it was wise to end communication....

I recently went back onto that account to ask for help. I had created a gofundme account as living on disability sucks, and I needed a little help to start earning my own money again. (I have a separate Facebook I just opened 7mo ago for family only and have been fine with that).

So with getting back on this old account, I was reading comments like ""if there is anything I can do to help"", so I thought I would give it a try... while trying to ignore the post from the woman who had an affair with my husband calling me a ""dear friend"" while I was in a coma and could not lose my ever loving mind on her.

You can guess where this is going... I am back to being ANGRY, HURT, BETRAYED , and a very unhealthy dose of self hatred /loathing constantly. These are people who knew what was going on, the pain I was in and still in and are seriously responding with things like ""glad things are going good for you"".

I am accustomed to not being heard when I speak, cry or beg for mercy... why was I such a fool to tell these people I am still suffering? Why did I try for help? Why did I think they cared? Is my brain so muddled that I convinced myself I mattered to these people? 

And last but not least... why do people honestly wonder why I don't leave the house or interact with people IRL?

TLDR.. I was a fool and thought revisiting an old Facebook looking for help, only to be reminded why I had tried to end my life.";1
965;965;1530_ptsd;I sometimes feelthings that aren’t there. Does anyone else? ((tw:sexual abuse)) Sometimes when I think about what happened too much ( I normally think about it at night because that’s often a time where I’m alone with my thoughts or might be trying to sleep in less clothing etc ) it’s almost like I can feel him touching me. Like his hand between me legs or something and I try to ignore it because normally it’s not too strong but sometimes it is. I try to change positions, roll up in a ball, squeeze my legs shut, roll around, or put a blanket between my legs to make it stop. It normally happens when I try to sleep in little clothes or without underwear in loose clothing. Often changing clothes helps, but the idea of taking off my already loose clothing is frightening. I never gave it much thought until now. I tried googling it and uh maybe wasn’t the best idea cause I couldn’t like immediately find a reassuring answer within the first few results. I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced this or found a better solution.;1
311;311;224_ptsd;I spent my life terrified of my own shadow...and no one but myself knew why I was sexually abused for years as a young girl, ages 8-10. My entire life I was literally scared of everything. Every guy that passed me on the street (still dealing with this one). Stair wells, parking garages, elevators, being alone, being with people, family, friends, friends of friends, the dark, I could literally go on and on! I spent every second of everyday scared, all because someone decided to hurt me as a child. PTSD never crossed my mind. I thought that was something only service members got diagnosed with. I never told anyone of my abuse until I was in my 20s, but even then I didn’t deal with it. I didn’t date until I was out of high school because I was so uncomfortable around men. If I ever met someone that didn’t scare me, I KNEW they must have been a good person, because that NEVER happened! It wasn’t until I turned 30 that I went to a therapist and started to deal with what happened to me. I am finally living a somewhat normal life. I still have many fears, but I don’t spend everyday terrified of life and things that COULD happen. For that I am very thankful!;1
1126;1126;2446_ptsd;"I started trauma therapy and this week has been awful I started a strand of trauma therapy called reliving and rescripting, where you relive the event/s as though its on a theatre stage, and listen ti the recording over and over, then change something in the memory so that it doesnt happen and listen to that tape over and over. 

I started the first part on tuesday, and i’m too scared to listen to the tape. i know its for my own good and it’s going to help me loads etc, but i cant bring myself to do it. 

since that therapy session, the days this week have been awful. i wake up crying hysterically, i get angry over the smallest of things, i find socialising an incredibly difficult chore, and im constantly on the verge of tears (spending the whole of today just crying over nothing). 

Im sure this is totally normal, but it’s all getting in the way, and i cant exactly tell everyone in my life why im behaving/feeling this way. If anyone has any words of encouragement or advice or anything i would greatly appreciate it, i feel so isolated and alone (and need to listen to the f****** tape but cant).";0
811;811;1401_ptsd;"I think I have an episode of PTSD. Help is appreciated. Hello.
I live in a very unsafe country. I grew accustomed somehow to the hazardous risk of my daily life (due to rampant deliquency) and fortunately, due to my residence in an upscale neighborhood, I haven't been really that exposed to the real face of danger.
Nonetheless, tonight, while scrolling down the timeline on Twitter, I came across this gory video of a young man (way too young, a teenager) been brutally beheaded after what looks like a horribly agonizing execution.
It seems it was the by-product of mafia wars but it occured in my home country, fortunately, far away from the capitol city.
However, the video shocked me so much that I can't really think of other things now. I'm really paranoid now that someone could break into my house and subject me to such a dreadful death. I'm paranoid about the domestic employee (from a poor side of the city) to gang up with others to assault on me in order to steal from me or something like that. It got to the point that I felt like throwing up at least a good half an hour after watching the video.

I have never considered myself sensitive to this kind of material. Actually I had watched several of them in the past but this one really hit home. 

I believe the paranoid thoughts (which I never had) and feeling unsafe for my dog and myself (due to a good part of the population being deprived of proper food and healthcare) are an episode of PTSD.

I want to thank all of the police officers, especially those fighting organized-crime for the daunting risk they take on our behalf. I believe that for the first time ever I understand how they expose their relatives and families and I really want to express my gratitude.

THank you very much for reading this and any help is appreciated.";1

I was proud to say that I escaped all of that and ended up in a healthy marriage. But I can no longer afford medication or therapy so I’ve been skating by basically.

As a kid, my family gaslighted me into thinking I was a walking disaster. If something broke, it had to be my fault. If I injured myself, obviously it was in character for me. But I am actually a very careful person and I work hard to appear “graceful” (also hyper awareness from my sexual assault - you will never catch me missing a step or tripping on the curb). It was normal in my family for my siblings to break something, blame it on me, and I got the beating and verbal lashing despite my proclaimed innocence.

So yesterday I had a cooking disaster. I damaged an expensive piece of cookware - but only aesthetically. It still works fine but it is no longer beautiful. I told my husband because it triggered me. I felt like I was falling into that family trap and had berated myself for an hour (I’m stupid and careless and clumsy and don’t deserve nice things).

I told my husband and he immediately starts lecturing me on how I shouldn’t have done that. I get emotional, “I know, I know! I feel guilty enough!” But I raised my voice so he started yelling back. I don’t even remember what he said but I felt like he was speaking to a bad dog and not his wife.

We reconciled some time later but the spiral started.

This morning we had a fight. I have a migraine and a lot of work to do. He kept talking to me while I was writing and it made me irritable. So I took a break to watch tv with him. He kept talking during the show. The show + his voice + my migraine made me feel like I was going to lose my mind. I couldn’t process anything. Construction started outside. I reminded my husband that he had to pause if he needed to talk. I asked him to shut the window. 

He lost it and started yelling at me again. That he couldn’t stand my mood. I started crying again, that I couldn’t process all the sounds and he knows this. He just kept yelling that I was bossy, selfish, I had a bad attitude.

I left the room and locked myself in the bedroom. He keeps yelling and slamming the doors. Huge huge trigger.

Now I’m scared and hiding. I have to shower. He’s mad at me and not coming to comfort me. I don’t want to see him and I’m afraid of having to talk because I just feel mute. I have to go to work soon.  I love him
But I don’t feel like I love him right now. I feel like he has been pretending to understand my ptsd. I know I wasn’t rude. I know I don’t deserve the yelling

1147;1147;2233_ptsd;"I think my abuser did more to me than I realize TW: Childhood sexual assault/rape When I was young, before preschool/kindergarten, I was babysat by a mormon woman. She had two children, a daughter my age and a son who was in middle/high school. The daughter was my best friend at the time and the son was mentally challenged. He would lure me into his room by playing the ""Barbie Girl"" song by Aqua, I loved Barbies. The mother would always make him take me to the bathroom, even though I knew where it was. He would touch me and force me to touch him. I still remember how cramped the space was and how he would stand in the stall with me while I went to the bathroom. I still remember how hot his penis always was. The babysitting stopped when I came home one day and told my mom that he had shoved his tongue in my mouth/down my throat. But neither of my parents knew the extent of the abuse until I was in middle school, half a state away.

Recently, I've come to the age where I should be getting a regular physical. The thought of opening my legs to anyone, let alone my female doctor, horrifies me to an extent I've never been frightened before. Even before she could explain anything, I was in tears and shaking uncontrollably. The speculum looks like a weapon to me. Even the thought of being in a hospital gown scares me. She says that I don't need to have one, but I want to have children and getting a physical is the first step to understanding my full health spectrum. I'm in therapy because I couldn't go through with the physical, and I still haven't been able to do it one year later. She won't put me out for it and only offers me ibuprofen and xanax.

Last night, even just thinking about the physical had me shaking and in tears. I curled up in a ball and closed my legs as tight as I could. Even now, typing this, I have my legs crossed tight. I think the son of my babysitter must have done more to me than just touching. I don't know how to cope with this. I'm still a virgin and have never had a real boyfriend. The last guy that tried to have sex with me was very insistent and I wasn't ready. He was disappointed and stopped talking to me when I pushed him away and accused him of only wanting me for sex. I want to have kids and I want to have sex, but I want to have them with someone I trust and love and who loves and trusts me back. I also have a horrible gag reflex and fear of blowjobs. I know that talking to my therapist is the best way to work through all of this but I have other issues that have taken precedence at the moment. I guess I just wanted to have the idea somewhere and vent a little. Thanks for allowing me to let this go into the void.

The problem is, is that if someone is robbing me in my home.... I have to go find and fight that shark. I swear I'll spend an hour sitting in silence just trying to hear something down stairs again. Even though the noise I heard was most likely in a dream and I know it.

498;498;256_ptsd;I was abused, I still am My sister liked to lie to our parents to get me in trouble when we were younger, by younger I mean I was five. I'm fifteen now. It may not seem like those lies she told did much, but it was everyday and eventually it took a toll on my mental health. I'm now depressed, paranoid, I have anxiety, and PTSD. My sister got worse with how she treated me. She started physically fighting with me. If we got caught fighting she would fake cry and blame it on me. Our parents were the type to give spankings. I got those a lot, because of her. My parents always believed her because she's almost five years older than me. I remember the first time I tried to kill myself, it was after she got me in trouble one morning. I have this loose ceiling fan in my room. I was always a smart kid, but sometimes not in a good way. I was five, and I thought if I hang myself with my jump rope from my ceiling fan then if the jump rope breaks the fan will probably fall and kill me. My mom walked in the room and saw me tying a jump rope to my fan. She yelled at me and took the jump rope. I wasn't allowed near jump ropes for six years. Two months ago I had cut myself for the first time, because my sister lied again. I had flashbacks to all the other times she had hurt me in someway. I had a breakdown, and things have just been getting worse ever since. I've had the urge to cut again. Luckily I haven't, yet. I'm trapped in this house. I'm too young to leave, and my sister won't move out. I think I'm going to die here, so to everyone who reads this I want you to know what I've been wishing to have for a while now. I wish that I could have someone in the world to love. Not just someone who will show me they love me. I want to have someone that I can give all my love too. Someone I can hug, talk to, cook for, watch movies with, play videogames with, someone who I can be there for when ever they need me. I don't care about feeling loved, I want to make someone feel loved. Sadly I don't think that I'll ever get to do that. So to anyone who feels that they aren't loved, just know that if I could, I would be there for you. I'm sorry I can't be there, but just know that I care. I'll always care, even if I die. I won't stop trying to make my wish true even if it kills me in the process. I'll only be happy if I make someone else happy. That is my purpose.;1

905;905;2068_ptsd;"I was in a car accident and now I have this weird thing happening to me at intersections I’m just posting this because I need to tell someone and I feel like no one really understands my ptsd and I actually don’t exactly understand what’s happening to me in specific situations, when sometimes stopped at a red light. 
I was in a car accident over a year ago where my car was t-boned at an intersection. I broke my pelvis in four places, a rib, and had a brain bleed. The most significant, long lasting affect of the accident is the ptsd I have now. I have road rage, and at almost every intersection I pass it’s very scary for me and I often will cry out. I feel pathetic because I’m 26 years old and even with friends in the car with me I’ll cry out in fear uncontrollably. Most of the time in the car I’m a little on edge but am fine, but when crossing intersections or if I feel another driver is acting recklessly near me I’ll get very upset. 
I have this one very weird thing happen to me when I am sitting at a red light. It happens sometimes but yesterday was the most severe, as I happened to get stopped on a red light at the same intersection where the accident was, it’s in a town over from where I live now and I avoid the area so I am not over there much.
Anyways so when I am sitting at the red light, I start to feel very woozy, and I start to feel like I’m leaving my body or losing control of my body. I can’t tell if I’m passing out or what exactly is happening but it’s frightening and I’m afraid I’ll lose consciousness. I’ll usually try to shake my head and kind of wake myself up or open a window, and by the time the light turns green and I can go again then it will pass and it will go away. Sometimes when I stop the car on red the episode will start where I feel like the car is still moving even though it’s not and I’ll press extra hard on the brake and realize I’m not actually moving, then the sickness/pass out feeling starts.

99;99;909_ptsd;"I was really triggered the other day and now I've been having anxiety attacks for no reason I was at a friend's place until really late the other night, like 4am, for a birthday. I called an uber and forgot to check that I didn't want to walk, so even though her neighborhood is really nice I ended up having to walk and wait on this semi sketchy big road

Uber is taking longer than expected and a man yells over that he wants to talk to me, I shake my head and he presses but I wave him off and he went away briefly. 

A few minutes pass, my uber hasn't moved (it's waiting on another pickup) and I hear the guy yell ""Miss! Miss!"" I ignore him but he starts coming to me and I get scared. He starts calling me beautiful and says he'll call me a cab and I say I have one coming and I start to call my friend because I feel like hey my chances of being murdered lessen if I'm on the phone.

He starts pleading with me to talk to him and saying he loves me and reaches his hand out and asks me to take it and I say no ans he just keeps inching closer to try and touch me. I say no again,  I'm on the phone with my friend but I don't want to talk about this guy while he's right there.

This guy starts accusing me of thinking he's dirty, and continues insisting I touch him. My uber finally comes and I cry in the car to my friend until I'm okay to hang up.

At work yesterday I thought I was okay but then I just kept having random breakdowns throughout the day. I don't have any meds for it and it's making it hard to function.";0
43;43;27_ptsd;"I was recently given bipolar meds. But I believe my issue is more PTSD. When I was initially given Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare, the diagnosis was bipolar. Personally, I believe that this diagnosis was given to me, so that I could get the federal benefits. But that diagnosis, from 5 years ago, is what other doctors seem to make their decisions off as well.

I don't have mania or elevated moods. I'm terrified of intimacy due to being molested as a child, which causes my depression. I need to describe this better on my next visit.

I've taken bipolar meds some years before, for probably a year. Aside from feeling weighed down, it didn't seem to do much for me.

310;310;940_ptsd;"I was watching Agents of Shield last night and I was severely triggered. I have no idea how to proceed. TW- Mental Illness/Kidnapping/Death/Childhood Abuse. This is a lot to unpack. I didn't know what to label the trigger warning in the title. I don't really know what this is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I was watching Agents of Shield. For anyone who is not familiar, an agent of the government died and was sent to Tahiti after his director and medical staff saved his life. Nobody seems to know how long he was really dead.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he starts having nightmares and slowly remembers the truth. He gets kidnapped and put into a machine that forces him to remember. He was never in Tahiti at all. He was dead for days, and he was put into a medical lab for display to the other, higher up members of his agency. His skull was off the top of his head, and his brain was being surgically worked on while everyone, including his direct supervisor, watched. One of the nurses was arguing with the one who was directly operating on his brain, and he was saying ""This is inhumane! Who ordered this?"" The other nurse replied that it was the agents direct supervisor, who was watching from above. They never knocked him out. Everyone stood by and watched him scream. He was saying ""Please, just let me die! Just let me die!"" He found the nurse who kept saying that the surgery was inhumane, and was told the truth; the memory he was brought back to was a fragment of what happened. He was on call for the seventh operation, and he didn't know what the operation was until he was in the room with everyone watching above. It's unknown how many there actually were, but he was 'in Tahiti' for a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

It brought me back to my teenage years. I was abused by my mother. I was bullied by my 'friends'. I have severe BPD from all of the trauma (the parental abuse lasted years) and all I wanted for a good two years was just to die. The pain was too much, and all I wanted was for everyone to let me go. Nobody cared how much pain I was in, including my direct bloodline, my mother. She just stood by and watched, and added to my misery. Just like the direct supervisor did with his agent. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped watching immediately and called my husband, who was at work. I tried to hold it in but I just cried and told him that I couldn't wait for him to come home. He knows I was severely triggered but I told him I didn't want to talk about it, I wasn't ready and I still don't think I am. All of that was five years ago now, and the more time that passes by, the easier it gets. I did therapy. I'm on medication. I was actually doing really well until about a week ago, where I started slipping back into a depression. That just punched me in the gut, and I feel like I'm right back to where I started; scared and not knowing how to cope. I'm not really sure how to end this, but that's what happened, and I'm still scared, and right now I don't know what to do.";0
103;103;693_ptsd;"I witnessed my fiance have two seizures nearly a year ago. Is it possible I have PTSD? Or is it anxiety? I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who do have PTSD and struggle with its symptoms. The last thing I want is to go around waving that phrase around carelessly and take away from those who have it.
Several months ago, my fiance had a seizure in my dorm. He has epilepsy so I've always had it in the back of my mind that if I notice anything weird to remain calm, but he is on meds for it and I had never witnessed a seizure before, so seeing him just stare at me and start screeching and convulsing out of the blue one afternoon took me by surprise.  I remained relatively ca and waited it out since he told me before that I shouldn't call an ambulance unless the seizure lasts a long time. I counted less than two minutes, which is fine. When he opened his eyes again, he didn't speak or seem like himself. He was just trying to  get up and climb on furniture while i tried my best to keep him from hurting himself. Eventually, he regained consciousness and asked what happened. I offered to take him to the hospital to get checked out since his dad recommended it over the phone, but he refused. A little later after he was back to normal he was on the phone, and my head rested on his lap. One minute he was talking, then the next minute I heard that awful screech again and jumped up. After two seizures, i decided to just call 911. He went to the hospital and all was well. 
For a long time, and even to this day, if he's joking around and accidentally makes a sound like he did or moves too suddenly, I panic for a second before realizing he isn't having a seizure. Early in I used to snap and get so angry at him for making weird sounds that sounded like that, but he honestly doesn't know what he sounds like during seizures and didn't mean to upset me, so i have gotten better about being more fair to him. We are long distance right now, and even when other people around me make strange sounds I feel my heart drop and I get so upset thinking that they could be having one even though no one in my family has ever had it. It gets me kind of angry to be frightened like that and ready to spring to action if need be only to find they're just being weird or having other less urgent issues. Is this ptsd, or just a more prominent anxiety? I do have a history of anxiety and am going to counseling for it.";0

Dear Tom
It's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.

I wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.

Peace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that.

I also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask ""how's school?"", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than ""good"" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.

So you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be ""normal"", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be ""normal"" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what ""normal"" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness.

The affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger.

I have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.

My anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say ""What's wrong with you?"". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.

My depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.

Since my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come.

I'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well.

You have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect.

You used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line ""you're destroying this family"" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted.

But now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said ""you're destroying the family""; what you meant was something different. ""Family"" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, ""Family"" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was ""you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear"" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me.

You'd also say ""I put a roof over your head"". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. ""I did my job, so now you owe me"". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the ""family"".

You aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.

I could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle. As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The ""zig-zag"" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom.

Words can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that ""my kid is dying"" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.

You might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your ""gifts"". The toys were a way of saying ""sorry I bashed your head the other day"", or maybe ""please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute"". The car was a way of saying ""please disappear"". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was ""destroying the family"" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a ""bad investment"" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple ""grudge"" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your ""gifts"".

Sometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. ""Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years"", ""nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?"", ""nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?"", ""nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?"". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in ""raising"" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and ""destroy the family"".

Another inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day.

I tried to explain what it was like to be ""raised"" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.

Moving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.

I'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.

On days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me.

I think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now.

It's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.

This letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to ""destroy the family"".";0
27;27;127_ptsd;"I'm (F20) really bad at this whole ""coping"" thing Hi.  I'm new to this subreddit, so I hope I dont violate the rules with this. 

I've had PTSD for a while.  I was assaulted as a child, by my cousin, then again at 11 by my boyfriendwho was 16, and again at 14 by a different boyfriend.

He's apparently VERY different now, but she doesn't know that he assaulted me.

I had a TERRIBLE nightmare, I woke up and didnt even remember where I was.  I won't go into details, but it SEVERELY affected me.  I dont know what I want to do, I want to run away and stay put.  I want to cry and I want to brush it off.  I dont know what to do, because i never played into the PTSD.  I didnt want my siblings or parents to know, i didnt want anyone to know.

I should have just told her that seeing his face again would bring back terrible memories but I thought that it had been long enough and that I’d be okay talking about it now, I was wrong.

467;467;459_ptsd;"I'm back in therapy and it was probably the best decision I could have made. Hello, all. I've been reflecting on the events of 2017, what with it being the new year and all, and I just wanted to share a little of my happiness with everyone. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years back because of extended trauma going back from elementary school all the way through to college. When I was diagnosed, I had actually sought out therapy for depression but due to some conversations with friends and the things I was currently studying in my Stress and Trauma class (I was a psych major) I realized that I fit almost every symptom listed for the PTSD diagnosis as well. 

I had been receiving therapy through my university's health program which allowed for a certain number of free visits every semester. But then my therapist left the university clinic and went into private practice. I continued to see her, but I couldn't afford the insurance copay and eventually stopped my visits altogether. On paper the fees were reasonable, but all my financial info was based on the fact that I was technically still considered my mom's dependent. In reality, she only paid for my insurance and I was living in poverty while trying to go to school because I was receiving pretty much no help from my family and couldn't find work. 

From then until just a few months ago, I wasn't receiving any treatment for my mental health issues. Last year was rather hellish for me. I was in a much better situation financially, I lived in a better apartment, had a job, and in a lot of other ways my life was objectively better. But emotionally, I was suffering. It hadn't been that bad for me since I had escaped the awful home life that traumatized me in the first place.

It took a lot of mental energy in a time where I didn't have much, but at my lowest point I finally researched therapy offices in my area. I got married two years ago and my partner's insurance covers most of the cost. Plus, we're fortunate enough that I can afford it without having to worry about still being able to eat afterwards, unlike when I was in college. So I called and made an appointment. 

That was back in October. I'm now going through CPT (cognitive processing therapy). It's really fucking hard, but so far it has absolutely been worth it. I'm putting a lot more time and effort into improving myself. I've been much more productive. I'm doing things I used to love again. Things that used to seem a distant dream or completely unachievable now feel like they might be things I can tackle - if not now, then *someday*. I'm more hopeful than I've probably ever been. My partner has been unbelievably supportive and has said they're really proud of me for all the work I've been doing. 

I'm not quite there, yet. It's still a struggle. But I'm making it. I feel like I can do this. And I hope that all of you reading this can claim some happiness for yourselves, too. 

Much love ~

TL;DR: I have gone untreated for over three years and just got back into therapy a few months ago. Already it's made a big difference and I feel like I'm getting my life back. ";0
17;17;117_ptsd;"I'm confused as to why this is screwing with me so much.  Is this normal or even okay? Tw Wanted to give a heads up that this deals with heavier situations/topics. please please be careful when reading!


So, when i was around the age of 13 I went to a mental hospital to help me with my suicidal thoughts and depression.  The place was horrible and caused me a lot of trauma.  The staff were abusive and gave me so much medication that on my 8th day of being there i only thought it was my 3rd day due to how out of it i was. 
So, for the most part i barely remember everything that happened there but sometimes i get random flashbacks to moments I either blocked out or didn't remember due to the medication. 

One I recently remembered happened around my last day there.  The only reason I left was due to the fact that i had a melt down during visitations and my family forced me out of the hospital, by now I'm questioning if this was one of the things that caused my tipping point. 

I have bad psoriasis, it was especially bad back then.  Covered 75-80% of my body, so i constantly had to use medicine.  The staff would give me it after taking my pills and I'd go to a private room by myself to apply it. 
Well, near the last day a nurse didn't hand it to me but instead took it, brought me to a different room, took my shirt and pants off without warning, then started applying it to my body.  She then went on to go underneath my underwear to apply it onto my backside. 

I was too confused and dazed to really do anything or tell her I was uncomfortable because the medication instantly hit me with drowsiness/fuzziness but i remember feeling humiliated and shocked by it. 

She was a female nurse, kind of sweet but could be very rude at times.  She often picked favorites as well.  This memory just came out of the blue and i instantly felt so fucking disgusted and shocked because it didn't seem or feel right and I never remembered it until i was just randomly looking back on my experiences there.  

I'm questioning if it's okay for me to feel this way about it.  I feel guilty because maybe she was just really use to taking care of little kids and got carried away? Is that behavior normal? No one else in the hospital did that to me from what i remember.";1

909;909;2401_ptsd;I’m having to relive my traumas for a court case and it’s really taking a toll on me. TW : Sexual Assault About a year and a half ago now I was raped. There’s a court trial tommorrow and I had to go to a meeting today. They need me to remember everything even though I went through months of therapy to forget everything. Every memory from it is coming back and I can’t handle it. I don’t want to have to be strong anymore. I feel like nobody is comfortable enough for me to talk to them about it. I can barely even get out of bed. It’s really difficult for me to get up and take care of myself. I know it’s gross to not be showering but it’s so hard to care. I just want to lay in bed and sleep all day so I’m not crying my eyes out all day when I’m awake. I’m feeling everything I did when it first happened, it feels like my body isn’t mine anymore. I want to restart and just forget everything. I feel disgusting in my own body.;1
1076;1076;2323_ptsd;"I’m in recovery, and doing well. But sometimes I just get so angry I was diagnosed almost a year ago now with ptsd, and my recovery is going 
really well. I get panic attacks sometimes at night still, but it’s no longer every single night, and I can get on the tube, stay at peoples houses etc and although I still get a little freaked out it’s definitely far more controllable than it was. Overall I’m happy with how well I’m doing. 

One thing I struggle with though is my anger. I have a follow up appointment with a therapist on March 3rd, which is 3 months after I was discharged as I no longer am any risk to myself (yay!) so I’ll talk to him about it, but I just wanted to post about it here.

Sometimes I just think about my situation, I had a good few male friends who decided to side with my friend who assaulted me, which is a pattern of how all of them have treated women. I didn’t realise how they treated the females in their lives until I put all of these events together and realised. They aren’t nice people, and sometimes that just makes me so angry because they’re all just going to live their lives genuinely convinced that turning against a victim of sexual assault and covering it up was something that was justified because of their own personal issues. It makes me angry to the point of tears and I just want to be able to keep it under control, but im not sure how.

I’ve been told this anger is normal, but I haven’t ever had to deal with it because before this i was super non confrontational and calm so it’d be nice to hear some tips, if anyone has any.";1

I don't have a specific event that I consider the worst,  as I'm dealing with lifetime of emotional and verbal abuse. I'm not really sure how to fill out these sheets.

               I've been having a lot of issues recently. I... need a public place to vent where things can stay anonymous. It's been getting worse recently but I've had what I can only assume is depression anxiety and PTSD which left untreated for the last 7 or 8 years as I do not have a good way to get to a doctor. I self harmed for years but stopped after Thanksgiving (American holiday) in 2017. But since before that I've been having an issue where occasionally I would have violent flashbacks of my abusive father and self harm and feel like I'm back in those moments and then to only get shot back into reality starring into nothing while in the midst of a panic attack. It didn't happen all the time and would usually be a few days up to a few weeks apart but recently it has become common and happens 1 or 2 to 3 or 4 times, if bad, a day. This mixed with a constant depressive feeling of dread, depression, and regression has made everything incredibly hard to deal with and I've start to crack recently and break down more often. 

                 I... don't really know what else to say. What are your opinions? I'm just sort of struggling right now and need to vent. Thank you everyone.";1
534;534;855_ptsd;"I’m not sure I will be able to go back to university (TW: abusive relationship) We dated very briefly, but before we dated, she was always very inconsistent with me - sometimes she’d talk to me, other times not. Once she disappeared for four months and suddenly contacted me, apologising for not responding. 

She has broken up with me twice; the second time was very traumatic and sudden, and I am still getting over it. I have developed PTSD as a result of being involved with her. 

The mere thought of returning to university induces a panic attack; she is likely to ignore me (which she’s done often in the past) and this too causes panic attacks. 

She acts very charming and happy with everyone in the class, and even seeing her do this makes me feel anxious. Her entire presence causes me stress and anxiety. The sight of the university building causes me anxiety. Everything to do with her and the university makes me ill. 

I am worried about going back there, and I’m starting to think I’m not able to.

585;585;1302_ptsd;"I'm not sure if I have ptsd or not.. I wish I could have thought of a better title for this but honest to god I can't. It's not something that's particularly weighing heavy on me, I just wanted some input. I'm a 23 year old male from Columbus, Ohio also.

Last fall/summer I was the victim of domestic abuse. My girlfriend at the time beat the shit out of me without any warning, it was my first and hopefully last time ever experiencing something of the sort and the fact that someone I loved so deeply could have did that was what really made it worse more than anything... It was only one time that this happened.

There's been a few times where I'll be laying in bed before I go to sleep and I'll see flashbacks of it and go into a panic attack. The way she breathed heavily before it happened, nearly hyperventilating. The way she marched up to me in silence and hit me square in the face... me repeatedly screaming at her to stop whilst trying to restrain her. It all would just come out right before bed but never during my day and these panic attacks maybe happened 2-3 times. This was in the first month after it happened and it hasn't really happened since... as time went on I accepted what happened. Or atleast thought I did...

Fast forward nearly 4 months. Just yesterday when I was at work, I was minding my own business doing my job when I heard a woman frantically yelling at somebody somewhere across the warehouse. It very much reminded me of the way my ex yelled at me the way she did that night when she assaulted me.. The type of loud yelling from a woman where their voice starts to grow hoarse from it while they're yelling. Idk it's hard to describe... but suddenly, I stopped what I was doing and began to shake and hyperventilate as those same flashbacks of that night I described started happening. I put my scanner down and went to the bathroom and had a panic attack on the floor.

The reason I'm not sure if it is PTSD is because it was just one instance where domestic violence occurred in my life, to me it could just be me still not being able to accept what happened. Normally you hear about the common case of combat veterans, rape victims or people who endured prolonged abuse in a relationship that develop PTSD but I feel like one instance of abuse like that shouldn't cause someone to develop it... or maybe it can. That's why I'm on the internet asking strangers about it.

At first it was disbelief, then fear (not knowing if they caught everyone) then crippling sadness.  I had such a strong desire to run away and just go home but I couldn't right away.  One of my coworkers was shot and spent months in ICU.  I left Christchurch a little over a week after the attack.  It felt wrong, but I had been offered a job back home and had already put my notice in at work.   

At first when I got back home and started my new job I was mostly fine.  I was living with my parents until I could get an apartment in the city closer to work.  I moved into my apartment in May and started having issues pretty quickly.  Waking up multiple times a night, disoriented and sweaty.

I've always had problems with anxiety and mood swings so I'm having a hard time distinguishing from old symptoms and new. Part of myself keeps thinking that this isn't PTSD, this is just my anxiety coming back.

1104;1104;1552_ptsd;Idk Today I was telling my mom about a bully at school and then she started fussing at me for letting myself have a bully. I was just fine with her fussing at me till she raised her voice a tiny bit. Then I felt like her voice was 1000 times louder and it scared me. I sorta got flashbacks or memories forced to the front of my mind of my parents beating me and yelling at me as a kid. My mind went blank except for the memories and then I started sobbing and shaking. Then she started to full on yelling and screaming at me for being a wimp cause I was crying. I can’t handel someone yelling at me. It just reminds me of my parents. I don’t wanna be that one person that self diagnoses themselves, but I sorta think that I have PTSD from childhood trauma. Any time someone even slightly raises their voice(even if it’s positive) I start crying and shaking. Idk. Someone please tell me if that sounds like ptsd or if I’m just over thinking it.;0
749;749;2471_ptsd;"If justice was real. (TW: violent thoughts?) I wish he could properly be punished for what he did to me. I'm tired of paying the punishment for his crime for him.

 I'm tired of the nightmares I have of him, of freezing up when I remember how he used to look or sound or feel or smell. I'm so sick of feeling severely physically ill every day because of all this. I've had to take a lot of time off from work, spend time and money on treatment, deal with debilitating physical and emotional pain from what he's done to me. On the worst days, I'm bed ridden, I've lost weight because eating is hard on a lot of days. He fueled an eating disorder that I'm trying to recover from and it makes my lack of appetite from this stress even more complicated to deal with. 

It's unfair. I can't report him to the law, the police wouldn't be able to do anything. 

But I hope he's still truck driving. I hope when he steps on a truck one day, he gets into a one vehicle accident and no one else is harmed but him. I wish he could burn alive, trapped inside his truck and have a long, painful, horrible and awful death.

 Would it fix any of this? No. I'd still be suffering, and he still would have abused me and threw a giant wrench into my entire life. But right now he's happy and he has a bunch of friends and he gets to go have fun everyday. I'm scared of every new person that comes along because what if they're like him? I've cut contact and blocked him everywhere, but what if he still finds a way back? I can't deal with people touching me anymore. Sometimes I'll have someone at work touch me and each time it makes me feel physically sick. 

He's done all of this to me, and I'm enraged that he has gotten away with this unpunished. Everyday I find myself hoping that I'll hear that something bad has happened to him and that it will maybe be enough to make up for what he's done. 

But I don't think he'll ever have to pay for any of this. But that I will continue to do so. And it tears me apart to even think about.";1

One friend ended up being out in 4-8 foot surf with rip tides and sharp coral for an hour and a half, almost 2 hours. I was giving the military police a live update of the situation over the phone and trying to coordinate rescue with the Japanese coast guard.

1082;1082;2224_ptsd;"Insomnia and loss of appetite from my event(s) I think that a lot of things have happened in my life that qualify to have caused PTSD, but usually I forced myself to not feel those emotions or try to rationalize the event in my head so I didn’t have to deal with any feeling other than personal accountability.

But this last event, that happened in December, was bad. The things that happened after it were also bad. Talking to the police was bad (and ineffective). The person who did this is still doing it to other people and that’s bad. They’re in my town and that’s bad. I’m so terrified of running into them. I check doors and parking lots constantly and obsessively. I know that’s not normal but it’s better than having to see them.

On top of that I’m not sleeping or eating. I can’t fall asleep at night, even after 1-2 doses of light sleeping meds. The most I can manage is four or five cumulative hours per night (max). Food doesn’t taste good anymore. I have to force my self to eat, but it’s sometimes easier to just let myself be hungry because with my intense workout schedule, I’m hoping it will just make me tired enough to sleep at night if that makes sense. Yesterday I tried boxing without headgear + weak defense to see if getting hit hard enough would help me sleep.

And when I DO sleep it’s just bad dreams. Not fun.

No; therapy is not an option currently. My family doesn’t know my PTSD is this bad but it’s much better if they don’t (it will get tense, lots of explosive fighting, etc). 

I’m worried because last night, at boxing practice, I think everyone noticed something was wrong. Or at least a lot of people. They said I looked really tired and like something was off. It’s a small, close group too. One guy talked to me after everyone left, and said if something’s going on I can talk to them.

I felt horrible because I didn’t know what to say. In my experience, people don’t genuinely care unless they get something out of it. Generally they just don’t. I don’t want them to treat me differently if they find out what I’ve gone through and what I’m dealing with mentally. They’re the only group of people that treats me with respect, and that’s the only place I feel like my hard work is validated. I don’t want that dampened with pity. And that’s assuming they’d want to be involved in this at all...

679;679;2209_ptsd;"Intense (triggered) fear of drugs I have no idea where to post this, and I’m even sure I have ptsd I just don’t know how to deal with this. When I was in middle school my older brother got into drugs and became a heroin addict shortly after. My mother would cry everyday and act coldly toward me and my little brother. She would go on fits of panic hyperventilating and pacing through our whole house and saying stuff like “please god just take my life instead of his”. My dad would scream at my older brother horrible things and I don’t blame him because my brother was horrible. He would steal things like my favorite video games and pawn them for drug money and I was too scared of upsetting my parents so I wouldn’t tell them. I loved my brother so much I wanted to protect him even though he was ruining my life. I would find his burnt spoons and pills and just sob all night. I watched him but drugs from weird cars in front of our house when I’d get home from school. Sometimes the drug cars would sit outside my house when I was home alone and I was so scared and confused. I would walk past his room and he would be sitting still with a blank expression staring at one corner of his room like a zombie. He actually overdosed and was dead until he was resuscitated in the ER. My parents would pay for different rehabs and they never worked. My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house. I felt so alone I would cut myself and make myself throw up or I would hysterically cry randomly at school or with friends. I wanted to just get in a car accident or find the courage to kill myself. I couldn’t ever get help or tell my family because it would make the situation worse. All I wanted was for my mom to hug me and say everything was going to be okay. 

Now I’m 19 and he’s doing much better. He seems to be clean but you can never really be sure, but he seems much happier. But I am left with this scar that I don’t think will ever go away. I fear drugs of any kind, I fear alcohol, I fear it all. Being around people doing those things make me panic on the inside. I do a good job usually of hiding it, but then I go home and cry. It’s hard when everyone I know my age does all sorts of drugs and drinks. I’ve lost friends, It’s caused a breakup. I avoid movie scenes with drug use because it makes me that sick to my stomach and memes or people talking about drugs absolutely ruin my day. The thought of my boyfriend smoking or drinking still disturbs me greatly and makes me cry, but I don’t want to control him. I know people use these things to find peace but I don’t know why and it makes me so intensely upset. I wish I could protect everyone from these things but I can’t. I know i sound crazy. I don’t cry as much anymore. Sometimes the urge to hurt myself returns but I do well at suppressing that.

529;529;1177_ptsd;"Introductory post..kinda?//about my PTSD Hi guys. I’m new to this sub reddit.


I’m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. 
I totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn’t do anything. 
I had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn’t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don’t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.
I’m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can’t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can’t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. 
I also watched the worst accident I’ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I’d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn’t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn’t ok to drive. 
So.. yea. I don’t really know where I was going with this, I guess I’m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they’re doing better now. 
I don’t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can’t even do those things.
I’m trying so hard. I just feel like it’s pointless sometimes. 

Anyway if you read this super long post..
Thank you. It feels nice to finally be able to have a voice.";1

I have a “friend” who is essentially a pathological liar and has a history of doing unscrupulous things, and I kept forgiving them in the past, but I was thinking I was ready to stop having that kind of unnecessary bs in my life and just stop contact with them, since it wasn’t doing anything good for my life and could honestly be dangerous since they have a history of suing people, making false accusations, etc.

But I heard on a post online that “withholding contact as punishment” is a form of abuse, and I do not know if this applies here. And if I claim that I cut off contact because they are not good for me, does that mean I am blaming the victim? I have been abused in childhood but I also dealt with my abuse in all the wrong ways, and I became abusive myself (not to this person) in the past. However I am completely reformed now, in a lot of therapy, but I am so, so scared of messing up again accidentally by not knowing what is abuse and what isn’t.

First things first, I in no way intend to be disrespectful, or undermine the experiences of anyone with this post. I am really scared to post this because I’m preempting negative or hostile responses regardless of how supportive and nice this community seems, so please be considerate if you intend to comment. Also, I probably won’t look at the comments for a long time as a way to reduce the fear I’ll feel when reading them. So keep that in mind if you’re expecting a reply from me. 

I experience social anxiety a lot. And quite severely too. Even with medication and regular therapy it still affects my daily life to a great extent. 

For those of you not familiar, social anxiety disorder could be summarised as an intense, usually irrational fear of being judged by others. Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it. Basically, it’s a very irrational fear that I’m very aware of. Regardless, I have little control over it as it is essentially instinctual, as y’all probably understand. 

Every now and then something will happen in my life that causes me great stress. A mundane event that becomes worse when combined with my SAD. Usually this is some form of criticism. The symptoms I’ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I’ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I’m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. 

For example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can’t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn’t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember. For weeks after, the topic of volleyball caused great stress to me. 

The thought of practicing or going to games caused panic attacks. When I thought of the event my core would seize up, heart rate would increase, limbs would start trembling, and sometimes my breathing would speed up or become sporadic. A bit like a mini panic attack, without all the symptoms or duration (these episodes lasted a few seconds, 10 at the most).  

I would avoid the topic of volleyball for weeks after, even stopping reading a book series that mentioned volleyball because it reminded me too much of the event. I would lose interest in volleyball, despite me actually really enjoying it. 

It’s been a few years, but thinking of this instance still causes some of these symptoms, to a lesser degree. I don’t think I’ve ever had nightmares about this specific situation, but similar events have had negative influences on my dreams in the past. 

I’ve provided examples of these symptoms in relation to /just one/ event, but keep in mind this still occurs for all of my most stressful experiences which are numerous. 

Idk. I just feel kinda bad posting this here, because there are people with legitimately debilitating symptoms from horrible experiences and I’m curious about my problems, which are comparably laughable.

195;195;472_ptsd;"Is it possible to heal PTSD? A little bit about myself first... at the age of 16 i almost died in a car accident by myself, at 25 i got hit by a family van at 45km/hr on the street. and at the age of 27 i got in another car accident at 70km/hr.   
So yes I've got some serious trauma and all my life i asked myself one question. how can i be happy in my whole being naturally like a baby does? 

  
and I've went through an amazing journey to discover really deep fundamental of life. I've always been a positive and resilient guy and that helped me a lot in my life.

  
but i wanted to create my dreams and one of dreams was to be happy again in my body. i knew that for that to happen i had to find a way to heal these past trauma.

  
My goal was, how can i be able to think and relieve a trauma and be free from the emotional baggage of it because i knew that your life is the reflection of what's inside of you.

  
So here's the step by steps way to do this. warning! trauma can take a while to heal but if you stay consistent with this you will see a really big difference over time and it can be rough to go through this but it is worth it.

  
so the first step is to think about the trauma and then really focus on your whole being (emotions, mental, physical and energical patterns) when you think about the trauma.

  
feel the feelings related to the trauma scale them from 1 to 10, 10 meaning it's the worst feeling ever.now take your two hands in front of you and do this. imagine all these feelings, these beliefs etc... imagine them going into your hands and push them into the universe take a breath wait couple of seconds. 

  
**it doesn't matter if you don't believe it will work. DO IT! for the sake of your happiness!!!**

  
then refocus on the trauma and see how you feel NOW thinking about the same trauma. 

  
scale on 1-10 again (sometimes you can feel the emotions spiking up it is alright just continue this process.)

  
see how you feel thinking about it and do it again

  
so see the trauma, see how it makes your body react, scale it, put it into your hands, send it to universe, take couple of breath. verify how you feel again.  
RINSE and repeat.

  
Did it work for you? if not comment below i'll help you.

968;968;1658_ptsd;Is it too soon to know if I have ptsd from a traumatic incident? Its been almost a week and I swear every day has been worse than the last. My heart is racing 24/7, I can't breathe, I'm too scared to be at my house alone but also too scared to leave alone, certain noises send me straight into an anxiety attack. I have vivid nightmares of the incident when I can actually fall asleep. I've spent a majority of every day crying because I just want my life back. I want it all to end. I don't wanna go to court. I don't wanna be responsible for sending someone to prison for life. But I wanna be protected. I want them gone for a long long time but why do I feel guilty when I'm not the one that caused it. I know I shouldn't feel bad at all. But that doesn't stop it. I need help..;1
877;877;2108_ptsd;"is ptsd always about a singular (or several specific) events? can people develop ptsd from long-term bad things? like, for example, having a (mostly not-physically) abusive parent, or childhood neglect? or does it have to be an event?

also, can it be an event that wasnt literally traumatic? like the death of a sibling, if you were not there when it happened?";0
828;828;2090_ptsd;Is there a good book that describes the impact PTSD can have on dating, intimacy, romance? A counselor first connected intimacy and trauma for me a few years ago, but I did not take her seriously until now. Is there a good book on this subject?

377;377;1096_ptsd;"Is this ptsd? Hey guys, forgive me for not doing a lot of research before posting this here. The thought just popped into my head, and I've got to get back to work so I wanted to ask while it's on my mind.

My previous job had me on call 24/7 for a little over 3 years. It was in the medical field, and if a patient or nurse called me any time, day or night, I had to respond to the call. I would work my 9+ regular hours at the office or in the field, and then several more hours a day after hours on call, not to mention every weekend.. It was a good job, but I absolutely hated that part of it. It caused me to lose a lot of friends and put a lot of hardship between me and my family because I was ALWAYS at work.

Anyway, about 2 months ago I decided that I needed to leave that job for my own mental well-being. I should note that I had always kept the standard AT&amp;T ringtone on my phone. After my last day, I changed my phone number, ringtone, etc. I needed to be free. Since leaving, I have noticed that almost everyone has that ringtone. When I'm out shopping or at a restaurant and someone's phone rings with that ringtone, an almost overwhelming amount of anxiety washes over me to the point that I almost feel sick at my stomach. After 10 minutes or so, and as quickly as I can distract myself with something else, it's mostly gone but I still feel ""off"" for a while. I even still hear ""phantom"" ringing a lot, where I will be alone and think my phone is ringing but it isn't. Typing this all out makes me feel like I'm crazy or something. Is this PTSD or something else, and if so, how can I get over it?";0
239;239;806_ptsd;"Is this ptsd? So to preface, I had an accident last year that involved me breaking my shoulder. I knocked the humeral head off the shaft and it was hanging together by the muscle. I then broke it two more times in the span of six months. The third time was a surgery where they had to break it and pin/plate it together after a malunion. 

Ever since surgery I’ve had several severe nightmares. Lately they’ve become a nightly occurrence. I feel the pain all over again, and I wake up crying/in a panic. Anytime I hear a plane flying I get very nauseous and I feel like I’m gonna pass out. A plane had caused my horse to panic and they threw me off, causing the initial break. The thought of even getting on a horse again is impossible, but I was raised around them. When I see my scar from surgery (the doctor left my staples in too long and my skin grew over some of them, causing more scarring), I feel very very upset. I can’t wear tank tops anymore because I just can’t stand seeing it. I haven’t told my therapist about this (I’m in therapy for other mental issues) because this all feels silly. 

Four of the eight therapists I’ve been to have mentioned that they want me to get tested or whatever for ptsd because of other things that have happened in my life. (I’ve been in therapy since I was 7).";0
96;96;916_ptsd;"Is this PTSD? What do I do? (19 y/o male) About 2 months ago one night  I was delivering a pizza to an apartment building for my job. I left my car door unlocked for convenience when i just walked like 30 steps to the door to deliver it. A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. 
Since then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could’ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I’ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could’ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I’ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don’t really have nightmares.
I just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it’s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I’ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don’t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I’ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I’ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I’m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I’ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I’m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn’t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn’t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don’t want him to think I’m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he’s made it clear before that he doesn’t generally prescribe benzodiazepines. What are my options? I desperately need advice. Sorry for the long and badly structured rant by the way.";1

541;541;592_ptsd;"It Took So Many Years I’ve been seeing therapists and psychiatrists for the past 6 years. For 6 years each and every psychiatrist would come up with their own diagnosis of what’s wrong with me. I’ve been labeled with traits of psychosis, border personality disorder, Bipolar, Depressive bipolar, and now finally, PTSD. 
I’ve finally found a doctor that was actually willing to listen and cooperate with my therapist to find the perfect diagnoses. One single disorder and that was PTSD. 
I took it as a shock at first. I didn’t understand how I could have PTSD? I always assumed that only veterans suffered from it. I’m still learning about it. Learning my triggers and my good and bad days. 
My biggest trigger is family. I can’t deal with my family after enduring years of physical, sexual and mental abuse. 
It’s so hard to stay away from them and cut ties. I’ve moved out of my home country and relocated all the way to the United States just to get some distance. Yet they never fail to find ways to manipulating me.

I was a virgin planning on saving myself for marriage, I had never been kissed before, and that night I was raped repeatedly in every way imaginable for about three hours and forced to perform oral sex on my attacker. 9 years later I still have horrible emotional flashbacks where out of nowhere I will feel incredibly disgusting, filthy, and shameful. I’m so angry with myself for not being strong enough to just get over it when I know other people who got over it much sooner and I’m still struggling. I’ve had a lot of people tell me I need to grow up, stop wallowing in self-pity, pray more and try harder spiritually (I’m a Christian), and so I try to stop feeling emotions about it and be strong but that makes it worse. why can’t I just let it go? what’s wrong with me?;1
314;314;818_ptsd;"It’s been some rough stuff Lately I’ve been feeling like my quality of life has gotten so much better since I’ve gotten a better therapist and since I’ve gotten my medication figured out, but I’m still having sleeping issues. 

I was prescribed trazadone of 1 to 3 tablets a night and it’s insane how heavy the carry over is into the next day. And I’ve had other sleeping medications and it’s the same thing. I just feel so exhausted all the time because I know my quality of sleep is not good. 

My partner, bless him, I swear, tells me he hears me talking and grinding my teeth hard in my sleep. I also sweat to the point of soaking my sheets and every morning I wake up and my hair is so wet you’d think I just stepped out of the shower. It makes me so self conscious to say, but I’m having the most trouble communicating with my doctor my struggles. 

I used to have terrifying vivid nightmares but I haven’t really had them/ remembered any of them since I started smoking marijuana a few years ago. My partner says he thinks I’m having them sometimes. I don’t really know what to do. 

I’m not in a legal green state otherwise I’d have my medical card and I’m sure more of my doctors support, but I’m not so sure. She knows I smoke and doesn’t hate it but doesn’t approve. My therapist doesn’t give a shit. 

Tonight I was even having such a hard time I just bursted out crying after having an outburst at a banker because of having no money due to the holiday and me getting off late every Friday to be unable to deposit my check until after hours and my bank said something was possible and tldr when I get there it’s the opposite so I’m full of frustration and lately I’ve been feeling as if I’ve been disassociating and just disappearing into space with the fact that I’ve had a lot of time off of work lately because my boss has been on vacation I just kind of summed it up to having too much time on my hands.

 And while that’s partially true, I have had too much time to sit around with just me and my thoughts. I also recognize that I have a harder time around the holidays and winter in general. 

So tonight I canceled my late therapy appointment and just came home and drank wine in a onzie and cried until I smoked enough to feel good enough not to cry. 

I’ve been having a hard time talking to my therapist because I don’t ever know what to say. She presses a little and I just say it sucks and it is what it is and I can’t change it and then like it’s book closed. 

I don’t know how to communicate or open up I don’t know what I’m supposed to do to get over this because I need to feel like a fully functioning human being to work and be alive. But I can’t do that if I’m always sleepy and just shut out. 

I don’t feel as shut out with my partner but I’m happier around him and the air feels more clear. He knows my trauma and my shit and we don’t elaborate further, not that it’s a problem it’s horrible. 

I just need to know what I’m doing wrong because I’m trying so hard and this cycle sucks. Advice on sleep, sweats, and talking to your therapist would be dope. Also don’t be gross everyone sweats so like don’t go into detail even though I appreciate the advice lol";0
292;292;1356_ptsd;"It's been tough This is my first post and I'm not sure how to begin this so I will just dive into it. 

I grew up in an abusive household with my mother and step father. Mother would beat me and my step father would molest me since I was as young as 7 or 8 yrs old... or well what I can remember up until I was about 12. When I turned 13  I moved in with my sexist father.

Fast forward 2 years, I met my now ex of 4 years. I lost my virginity to him, however, he turned out to be very abusive 8 months into the relationship.  He raped me, beat me, and verbally abused me. Took 4 years to really get out of that toxic relationship.

Shortly after the break up  I was raped by someone I thought I was becoming friends with. BUT then again... what did I know about making friends. I was an outcast and had no friends growing up and my ex wouldn't let me have friends. Anyways this person stalked me and threatened me after. I quit my job and moved shortly after not too far but where he didn't know I lived.


In between and after all this... quite a few men has looked at me or/and treated me like some sort of toy for their pleasure. 

I'm so emotionally broken. I don't know what to do with myself sometimes. Since then I've met an amazing person who treats me right ... but I don't know if I really want to be with this person. I've made friends that don't hurt me and seem to care. 

But I have no one I can really talk to about all this. I mean they know the gist. But I'm that ""happy friend""-- you know the one that is never sad or cries, the one who listens and is always smiling. Keeping those happy, positive vibes.

Deep down though ... I'm sad. I struggle with a lot of anxiety and depression. I have PTSD and try so hard to push through each and every day. Some days It feels easier than others. Most days I can't focus on anything and am completely overwhelmed with my memories, thoughts, emotions. 

I don't feel like anyone around me truely understands what a toll all this has taken on me and how much it actually hurts me. To them it seems like because it is in the past I should be just fine and dandy now (like out of sight - out of mind type thing) or they simply have nothing helpful to say. 

I can't really blame them for not understanding. But I'm just going through it right now. My anxiety has been through the roof and I stupidly start to shake uncontrollably and breathing sounds like I'm shivering.

It was almost an out of body experience, the whole thing really. The shock wave from the explosion pushed us down the sidewalk, I felt it go through my body and down the sidewalk in front of me. All of the windows outside the building next to us instantaneously shattered, raining down on us and into our eyes.. I remember looking at my boss as he screamed at me to run. 

My ears.. it was like a tornado had just ripped through my head.. then then the pounding and ringing started. I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn’t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming ‘WHAT THE FUCK’ at each other out of shock.

People starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating ‘don’t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.’ I remember the confused look on their faces..

It’s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I’m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me. If we had finished our experiment a minute later, or stayed at the crosswalk, or happened to walk at a slower pace.. it’s so fucking terrifying. I’m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. 

Begging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they’re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it’s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...

It’s only been 4 days, but it feels like it’s been an eternity. I didn’t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it’s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...

I do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. 


But at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen? It’s all so surreal and yes I’m extremely thankful to be alive, but the survivors guilt immediately crept in. I’m a trained BLS instructor, and I just ran.. I understand there was nothing I could do to save anyone, but I still feel so much guilt and shame.. 

I just needed to get it all out. Advice on moving forward is welcome/appreciated.

He asked if he needed to get condoms but I said I didnt want to have sex. I was on my period too so I think its why he didnt do more to me. I always wanted to go to Sedona and Lowell Observatory and he took me there on our trip but he locked me in the hotel room, we never went to the observatory or even Lowell. He made me grind/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said ""but think about how id feel"" and pushed me down. He grinded into me and I felt himself kinda push in trough my underwear and I felt scared. I went home and we broke up a few months later after he moved to Germany and I just set my relationship as with someone else to get him to leave me cause I kept trying but hed make me feel bad ( I was 18 and dumb...) 

I only told my twin but never my mom. She would NEVER understand.  I had another abusive bf this year (23 years old) and he was VERY misogynist. Like an incel. He hid it and it came out later on. He knew of my PTSD and all his rape jokes made me freak out and cry. He said the last time we fooled around he would cover my mouth and ignore me saying no and I freaked out idk why hed say that and I left a few weeks later. 

I now am seeing a new guy, but hes 100% diff than anyone. We were bffs. Hes sensitive, kind, funny, sweet, very dorky and very loving in his heart. He feels like the boy me. He is very sexually intelligent and patient. After my trauma at 18 I decided I want to wait till marriage so I never ever have to have sex with someone who I wouldn't regret. After my incel ex I feel it even more the way he changed and warped. My current bf knows this he knows everything and he is fine with it. His last ex they never had sex for their whole 5 years and he said he has dated many virgins and waited till they were ready. All his close friends say he truly is a great man. Hes a unicorn haha. 

I really want to fool around with him more but I am very scared Ill freak out. I cant masturbate without him and I feel like a WHORE doing it alone cause of my past. I just want to be normal. I want to just have happy sexual experiences with my bf. I know he can give me them the way he is but Im scared ill make them bad. I just want to be normal. Therapy is so slow and its such few and far between where I make milestones in anything at all!! How does this go away?! I manage my OCD, my anxiety is improving but PTSD never goes away. I hate it. I want to cry. I was only 18 why did me make me do all that stuff. I didnt want too. I feel like a disguting slut I want to punch my legs till they are black and blue. I hate myself for what I let happen to me and the fear it makes me have. My partner gets concerned to trigger me, hes very slow and patient when we discuss sex. Being a virgin I ask him questions and he never laughs at me like other people do he just explains stuff kindly and sweetly. No pressure no meanness. I feel like a dirty mean bad person. I want to talk to him but hes also stressed at work today and I feel so mean. My therapist is on vacation cause of Jewish holidays :(  idk..

Idk....i just want it to go away already its been TOO MANY YEARS!!";1
624;624;1072_ptsd;"Iv had ptsd for 10 Years, I was never told what to expect or what a flash back is. A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn’t stand with out pain.
For the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I’d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I’d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn’t go in I’d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn’t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.
Because I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time

Iv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can’t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don’t really talk in therapy session and the reply’s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school

There’s an emotion I feel when I’m in a state sometimes, it’s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it’s like there’s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there’s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I’m experiencing and I’m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can’t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.

^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^

Luckily it does not happen that often.;1
317;317;1305_ptsd;"Just a venting thing. Well, I had to go through a lot a long time ago. It was very traumatic and was a consistent thing for 3 years. I had a therapist, but she moved and I just can't get another.

Now, I find myself thinking everything has gone away and like I'm okay. But I'm not. Every time I see something related to it, everything comes flooding back. 

My main concern is that I just, my brain seems ""broken"". I constantly have repetitive thoughts I can't control, and they're intrusive and scary (not in a violent way but it's always something im afraid of) and I've been having this extreme problem where my brain just seems to malfunction like fucking shit. Except it doesn't manifest in me seeing what happened before, it manifests in completely seperate and mild situations and even fears. It's like it's a disease that slowly grows roots into my brain and all that, even long past it being over.

It's like I'm putting the emotions from my trauma into everything here and now, that I think about even if it's not related. And then I don't even remember why I'm feeling what I am. And things just seem to be taking over in a way where everything haunts me, but I forget why so I literally have no idea why I feel the way I do. The only reason why I realized this could be because of PTSD is because someone mentioned it. But it's just so frustrating, it's like remembering a smell from a memory but you have no idea what the smell is or the context. And these feelings linger and screw with my head. 

I don't even think any of this makes sense, I have no idea how to explain it because I keep blanking out and it's like something won't let me think about it. I really thought I was just going crazy or something but everything clicked when someone mentioned that they had the same problems. I keep feeling like I should just delete this, but I also feel like I should just post it anyway. I hope this helps me, but I feel more frustrated than I did before typing this.";0
894;894;1424_ptsd;"Just diagnosed with PTSD. Support and any advice/info would be appreciated! My LTR recently ended (~6 weeks ago) and I have been seeking treatment for what I thought was depression. I (f/26) had been very depressed throughout my LTR with my ex (m/26), but had never really gained much from the therapists that I had seen in the past. After the break up, I began to seek help, but this time was more vocal about the treatment I was receiving. The therapist I have been seeing post break up has been incredible, and I think my life is about to be on a major upswing. Today he identified that I have PTSD (verbal/physical abuse in childhood) and that there are ways to treat this. For once in my life I feel like there is hope.

453;453;1352_ptsd;Just diagnosed, 24 years after the primary event. Hoping maybe you guys can help answer a question? I’m going through cognitive behavioral therapy (the writing type) and my therapist told me to hand write everything to prevent dissociation. I’ve heard of dissociation but only the most severe types with fugue or losing time etc. I’ve lost time before but I never really thought about it or even knew what it was until a recent job interview I don’t remember actually doing, just going in and coming out. I’m rambling because of insomnia, sorry. I’ve always done this thing where I sit in the back of my head and dispassionately observe my physical reactions to emotional events. Like even if I’m physically sobbing I don’t feel it in my head if that makes sense, I just watch myself cry and keep analyzing the situation and just sort of ignore my body. Is this dissociation? I don’t want to know what to do about it, I’m going to therapy and she’s amazing, I’ve just got a few days before my next session and I’m curious. Because now that I’ve handwritten my trauma narrative I’m not doing that and my brain is fuzzy as fuck and this goddamn hurts. So hopefully actually feeling this can mean the boil is lanced as it were? Anyway, love y’all and I hope your day/night is pleasant and restful.;0
364;364;1152_ptsd;"Just Found Out So yesterday was I guess what you would call a breakthrough for me in thearpy.

For the past month or so I have had a few family and friends say they think I have ptsd which I ignored heavily cause of that ""what do they know right?"" However my sister-in-law was one of them and her dad and older brother were combat vets and suffered ptsd badly so when she said it it took me off balance and I guess triggered me.

Well then Wednesday I had to follow up with my PCD on bipolar meds and we discussed how I feel like I've had set backs dealing with my depression that still persisted through the medication and even he said it sounded alot like I had ptsd.

Well I went to my normal therapist session yesterday and it felt different from the start. He was delving deeper into things I was saying more so then the content itself and finally mentioned ptsd twice which took me off guard again and got me flustered.

He caught me lying twice and I guess cornered me for lack of a better words and in a revelation or release I'm not sure which finally drove the nail home that I suffer from PTSD.

A huge chunk of the issues lays with my dad and how he was physically and mentally abusive to me, my brothers, and my mother who left when I was 2. I caught alot of the mental.

It hurt alot to finally admit it to myself and, that I felt very exposed.

Even now I still feel hypervigilant but I know where it comes from now.

My biggest worry is now that I know I'm afraid it will hurt to much and well make things worse and lead somewhere I dont wanna go to.

Sorry for the length I just felt I had to kinda tell someone or some people to I guess vent about it.

The last question is how do you guys cope with it? How do you handle or deal with your triggers now that you are aware of it? I've stayed non violent about it this whole time(alot of temper flares and screaming and yelling but no physical violence) but, I'm afraid some triggers may make.me that way now that I feel kinda vulnerable.

Anyway thanks for reading my story/venting/acceptance.";1
819;819;2676_ptsd;"just got diagnosed. I should start by saying I'll mention death and army (not American) related stuff so you can skip this thread if you need to.
_____________________________

Got the diagnosis just two days ago. Got medication and appointments to therapy or whatever. I'm already dealing with nerve damage in my spine and going to have surgery for the third time in a few weeks - while that fucking sucks it got skyrocketed by this new plot twist. Really, really struggling.

It's been years, maybe 15 years since my NCO shot himself. My search team found him. Great dude. A real brotherly authority figure. Trying to not think too much about that.

I never thought that that could have been the reason for my decline after leaving the military. Depression, isolation, numbness, severe dissociation, feelings of dread and doom (which I didn't know until very recently is anxiety), can't stand a certain smell of forest etc, constantly think ""If he killed himself being the fucking champion he was. What chance do I have?"", self harmed for a year after I left the army which concluded in a suicide attempt which left a huge scare over my chest which also reminds me. 

Never thought anything about it, I could not see my own problems and when I did I didn't link it to PTSD as ""I haven't experienced anything traumatic"". Just pushing anything related to that away subconsciously. The psychologist said that they called it ""the evading illness"" internally as it's extremely common to just block it all and say that you are fine.

Well, you people know all that. 

I don't know. I just had to write something about it that says ""hey this happened"" to myself. Between this and the surgery I'm struggling to find the will to go on. All I see before me is a mountain I don't have the strength to climb. 

I got homework to ready as much as I can about PTSD but so far I've been avoiding it and just shitpost on reddit instead. I remember he asked if there was anything I wanted to do, like a goal, I could not answer because I don't get joy from anything - but today I realized what I wanted. I want to stop.

No real reason to post this. I'm going to anyway, not even on a throwaway because this is real and happening no matter what I think.";1

I know he didn't have a great childhood and has struggled with addiction, anxiety and depression most of his adult life. He is 48 and we have only been together 6 years. I don't know what the trauma was that caused it but to be honest, I really want to ask. I'm not sure if I should ask though.  How can I offer support without seeming overbearing or crossing any personal boundaries? Can anyone offer suggestions as to how I can help?

1011;1011;1990_ptsd;"just looking for a place to process this and get advice or tips i hope this isn't the wrong kind of post for this place, if it is, i am really sorry! but my doctor has recently diagnosed me with ""late onset PTSD"" and i am trying to understand what this means for me going forward. im totally lost.

tw: SA, controlling relationship, stalking, drugged

\------

\------

\------

PLEASE be warned i explain the source of my trauma here and i dont want anyone to be triggered.

&amp;#x200B;

i've recently been diagnosed with what my psychiatrist calls ""late-onset PTSD"", which i did not know was a thing that could happen. it stems from a pattern of episodes from when i was younger where my first serious boyfriend repeatedly drugged and raped me without my knowledge (until one day i wasn't ""out"" when he did it and tried to break it off with him soon thereafter). he then stalked and harassed me for about a year and a half after i broke it off with him. obviously the experience was upsetting and awful but i seemed to be okay for a few years after it happened. or at least i thought i was? 

&amp;#x200B;

but within the last several years i've had several people tell me that i seem like i've changed - i get extremely uncomfortable in big crowds (like at a concert) and i never used to feel that way, i obsessively check to make sure my door is locked, i feel the need to keep a weapon in my room even though i've never felt that way before, and i constantly fear that someone will break into my house (something that he would try to do when he was stalking me). there are other things but those are the big ones. i will be honest, i found out a few years ago that he moved out of state and i frequently check to make sure he is still far away from me, and i feel a lot of shame about that. i thought i was just having really, really bad anxiety related to the high pressure from school and work, and i've even been told that these periods of hypervigilance might be due to misdiagnosed bipolar II, but my doctor believes i have PTSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

i am in the medical field and my father has PTSD - i thought i understood this condition very well. but i guess i don't. so i am here to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience - a ""late-onset"" of PTSD - and how you dealt with it after years of thinking you had everything under control. i feel very lost, angry, confused, scared. it is hard for me to be intimate with other people in so many ways and i feel like i am losing my friends because of what i am going through. i am trying to find a therapist but they are all very expensive even with insurance, and i am on medication management (third round of combo antipsychotics and antidepressants, the last two didnt work, meds kind of help but not really). i don't know what to do anymore, so please, if you had a similar experience... can you share how you dealt with it? this is so exhausting.";1
352;352;1002_ptsd;"Just PTSD ramblings about a shitty PTSD day TL;DR Met someone else with PTSD. Tried to help - feel like I really screwed up, feel like maybe I didn't.

Sorry if I ramble, I'm a bit shaken up. I was recently introduced to someone who also has PTSD. I was a bit reluctant to connect but decided to be cautiously optimistic as there aren't many ways to meet people here (besides bars) or any local PTSD peer/group resources in our area for civilians. Done all the one on one with counselors and need to connect in person with others who can relate. Knowing to be careful in any case, and not looking for dating (and making that clear to him), we met a only a few times and chatted about how to address PTSD symptoms in a healthy manner. Friendly and polite, encouraging his engagement with hobbies while having some laughs as we seemed to share the same type of humour. Just decent human stuff.

Fast forward to today. Another invitation but me declining as I'm sicker than a dog with fever and chills. Christ if I didn't suddenly get multiple messages about how he'd received bad news and was in the middle of a PTSD episode. On to how I grounded him and helped him think clearer and had hopes I'd find him attractive, etc. Then sharing how missed his army buddies who'd died and wanted to give up as life is too painful. Over and over again. I tried calling but he wouldn't pick up. Just more messages of the same nature. And more.

It's an unsettling position and my heart was going out to him. I used to have the same dark thoughts time to time. There was also more than one occasion as a kid where someone gouged their wrists open in front of me or I had to hold them down because they were trying to throw themselves in harms way.

Not knowing his family or anyone he might know, I looked up and called a vet line asking if they could help out. They instructed me contact the local RCMP. I did so, explaining the above and asking if they could just make sure he was okay.

They advised me to keep him engaged in conversation if I could while they sent someone over. Cut short our call when his doorbell rang. A few moments later, the RCMP called me back asking about his phone as it was going straight to voicemail and he had all his lights out and curtains drawn. All I could do was repeat the number. About 15 minutes later, a call back. He'd stated he was fine and downplayed his claims, citing counselors, medications, etc that he says he's accessing so they left.

In come a bunch of nasty messages. To the effect of ""if I really cared, I would have come over myself. He went on to state he'd been thrown around by members when having a bad day but he was just sad. That he has negative feelings toward them. That he'd made the mistake in trusting me and I overstepped boundaries. That civi's can't be trusted. How his last girlfriend had done the same thing to him by calling when he was just having a bad day. It was her fault the they'd roughed him up"". On and on. 

I could only tell him that I didn't have much choice. That I'm not their hugest fan the past couple years myself but he's expressing suicidal ideology, and I don't know who he has in his life he trusts. That no one was out to get him here and that I don't deserve to be punished for trying to do the decent human thing. And that I am not his girlfriend (only physical contact had been a quick hug as I left a few days ago). That if he reads his miles of texts it shows his PTSD in getting in the way of of non-professionals helping him right now and provided the local crisis line number. I wished him well and reminded him that I needed to be healthy and care of myself by blocking him. Done. Nothing nasty or confrontational. 

Thing is, some stupid part of me still wants to apologize and calm him down. I'd meant no harm at all but screwed up. I'm jumping at every little sound and feel as though I'm somehow ""in trouble"" for some misdeed. I don't think my cell block even works properly but I'm afraid to look and find out. Having been brought up being held responsible for others' unpredictable actions and fists slammed on me for not measuring up to babysitting them, it can grind a person down. After how long I'm finally starting to see that in me now? Jesus.

I was also just starting to get to the point in life of emotionally realizing that I'm not as obligated as I feel or as others have guilted me to feel. There's a tiny part in me that knows I don't deserve this dynamic, and even wants to say ""I don't owe you or anyone else anything. Get off my back"". It doesn't feel strong at the moment, but it's probably just tiredness, flu, and needing to go back to bed. What a bunch of high school crap.

But I do miss my home city. You can at least try to escape into the crowds if you need to get away. Maybe even utter a quick ""Fuck off, freak"" before running.";1

I told some of my friends about this and I would be lying if I said I was disappointed by their reactions. They are all aware of my PTSD, but when I told them of this big milestone for me they all (except one) kind of blew it off as “oh okay cool”. So I just wanted to post on here because I haven’t felt this elated in a long time.";0
458;458;580_ptsd;"Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. 

Going to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. 

I was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.

I dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. 

I dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.

Honestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.

I feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. 

It's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. 

But still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. 

I'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.

I know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. 

**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks. I have a therapist appointment on friday, but a recent appointment with my psychiatrist, where he absently dismissed a diagnosis of PTSD as being 'purely academic' has me nervous about bringing it up with my therapist.";0

It stabs into my side. I'm going to die here. I thrash my body wildly, trying to escape, trying to survive. Suddenly an opening. My right leg is free. It has a clear path to an attackers head. This is my best and only chance. I kick with all my strength. I scream with rage.


My leg impacts something hard. It's dark. Where am I? My leg! Is it broken? I scream with pain.


Wait, I'm in a bed. My daughter's room! She was sick. I was cuddling her to help her go to sleep. Where is she?! It's too dark I can't see her! Did I just kick my daughter with all my strength? No no no no no! Fuck! Where is she?!

I scream with terror.


My wife runs in. ""What happened? Is she ok? She's shaking. Stop screaming.""

She's alive. Is she ok? I hold her. She's scared out of her wits but she isn't hurt. My leg! It hurts so bad. I think something is broken. I must have kicked a wall or some furniture.

""I don't think you should sleep near her anymore""

I see her in my dreams and its causing me to sleep for 14 hours a day during the daytime when I can actually fall asleep. Most times I wake up from nightmares though. 

I just needed to vent. Feel free to talk about whatever I guess. ";1
202;202;313_ptsd;"LCSW or Psychologist? Hi there, first time poster! 

I just recently started seeking out therapy, because I've finally decided I'm done being a dark, brooding, hateful type and I want to get better. However, it looks like my insurance only covers LCSW? Or that's all I've been able to find in this area.

I've never had a psychologist or psychiatrist, so I'm not sure what the difference is. The LCSW I go to has a religious theme I'm not sure I'm a fan of, but I'm wondering if it would be any better with someone else or should I stick it out. 

They also focus on ALL of me, instead of just the PTSD. I get that after it being in my life for a while that it's a part of me, but sessions are all over the place. 

What I'm saying is will the experience be the same with other types of therapy?

I appreciate any help in the matter!";0
1143;1143;2644_ptsd;Life is hell After four years and 2 car wrecks, one of which I was involved in (the other I unfortunately just witnessed) I've discovered I just cant live like this anymore. I want to be able to put the past behind me, but i cannot. I have no resources to fall onto. Being at the center and merely being at these two wrecks has impeded my ability and will to drive to the point I am almost refusing to get my driver's license. I know I'm probably saying 12 things at once and completely out of order, but my life has been fucked for four years. I think I'd watched someone die barely at 15 years old, almost died 3 years after that, my family began to fall apart with me all but cutting all ties to my brother. Fuck me. That's all I can really say. I'm sorry for just fucking amazing, but man, I just needed to vent before I popped like a brown paper bag. This is a throwaway because I dont want people tracing this back to who I am. I'd ask that you'd respect my wish for privacy.;1
538;538;1277_ptsd;Life on repeat Every night I have the same dreams, they are of some past experiences that will never go away. There are always two. The first one is when I was 10, it starts with me being beaten by family. The second with a part of my 13 year old self watching a man die. When I was 10 I was beaten every day by my parents and people who your supposed to trust I remember all of them every second of each punch, kick and being thrown. When I was 13 I was walking at home from school and I saw someone on there knees begging for change. So I gave them my left over lunch money 5.73$ I counted it out before I gave it to them. When I walked away I looked back at the man to see someone else standing above him with a gun. The guy sitting offered what I gave him to the man but I heard him say it wasn't enough. I watched as the man with the gun pulled the trigger and the guy sitting fell limp to the ground. The man ran away and I sat down were I was and just looked even when the sitting man was taken away. I remember these things every night. I see it all happen over and over again. I don't tell my wife why I scream at night. I don't say why I can't be left alone. I have panic attacks from what I've seen and have happened to me. I am afraid and alone. I've never been able to speak to anyone about this and I never will. I see the bearings and the limp body even when I'm awake. I've tried to hang myself or jump off my roof to get rid of the images. Nothing helps. I'm afraid that nothing ever will.;1

M: mom
s: sister 
(Sorry bout this I just got tired of typing “my niece”, “my mom”, “my sister” without using names)

TRIGGER WARNING
deadass don’t know what all I typed but I know this probably needs a trigger warning 


So today my mom drove two hours to pick me up at my house (one working car between me and my husband right now) and two hours back to her house. I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn’t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn’t. 

I mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn’t doing anything wrong. Like my mother fucking pINCHED HER ARM and held it as tight as she could when she wasn’t walking fast enough to her liking at a gas station. I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn’t until I said something that she stopped. I think it’s just because I’m an adult now and she knows she can’t scare me into shutting up when I see something shitty. 

Not even the worse part of the day? For me at least. Poor N probably is just tired of feeling like everything she does is wrong. Maybe I’m projecting. I don’t think so though. 

We were out to eat with S who I haven’t talked to in months. I texted her months ago when I was in a deep depression and basically went off on her about the dent in the back of my skull. It wasn’t a lot. We were in an argument when I was probably 16. I turned around to walk away and she grabbed a can of food and just started hitting me over and over again in the back of my head. It hurts to this day. Every time I think about it I cry. 

ANYWAY, out at dinner. First time I’ve seen in S in months. M has convinced me to try and mend the relationship. I start off by saying I’m sorry. I was immature about the way I went things and I should of just tried to talk to her about it because she’s my sister and I love her. The entire time I’m saying all this she’s looking at me like I’m the most disgusting person on the planet. I finally stop and ask if everything is okay. Honestly I don’t even remember what she said. It’s fucking cliche but it’s literally all a blur. This always happens. Whatever she said is just not even a memory. Whenever I’m in conflict of any kind I can’t remember what was said. My body like shuts down. I can barely hear my own thoughts. My vision has blurred in and out before. Lately when I’m panicking I can’t hear anything. It’s scary. I don’t know if these are symptoms. I got diagnosed with PTSD and haven’t been back to the doctor since. It’s fucking terrifying. 

I remember what I said before I walked out of the restaurant. Something shitty about her creepy ass boyfriend? (I only feel this way about him because he tried to fuck me when I was 16 and he was 20. She knew this. Is now living with him) 

I just stood at the back of the restaurant and trembled. I called my husband and just balled and asked him to pick me up. Felt like 5 minutes had passed but it’d been 20.  My mom texted me my niece was upset so I went back in because I honestly hate that she even witnessed this disfunction.  

I don’t even know anymore. I just miss my family, but I hate them. I’ve had so many traumatic experiences in my life and almost all of them (including being molested) were caused by FAMILY. It fucks with me. I was raised to believe the most important people were family but at the same time they caused me the most pain. And continue to do so.";1

1194;1194;1588_ptsd;"Losing all my safety nets Ok, let me start off by saying that I understand the response to coronavirus and that everything that I'm about to talk about has happened for a good reason. My mental health has also been really good recently and I haven't needed to use any of the following safety nets for a few weeks. But that doesn't stop me from stressing out.

I live in the UK. My parents are a major support system for me but they live in Spain. In the past when I've been really unwell they've gotten the first flight out and been at my side within 24 hours. Obviously right now if I was to become unwell there's absolutely nothing they can do. 

When I get paranoid or hallucinate I tend to go to the drs, not to see the doc but the receptionists will let me sit in a room with some water and help me calm and ground myself. All our drs surgeries are closed unless a doctor has specifically asked you to come in. When I get unwell I am a danger to myself and others, so losing this safe space is very scary.

All my mental health appointments have been cancelled. I was due to have a CPA (annual review with all the people involved in my care) next Monday and I see my care coordinator every two weeks. None of this is happening.

I understand why all these measures are in place and I know how important they are but I'm just feeling very alone and overwhelmed right now. It doesn't help that my husband suffers from major recurrent depressive disorder and is having an episode at the moment. So neither of us are in a fit state to help each other!

414;414;1009_ptsd;"Loss of interest in everything. Anyone else experiencing this? 

I’ve finally gotten help for my PTSD and while I feel positive it will actually help me, I’m struggling to function. I work 8-5 and I’m exhausted from dealing with insomnia most nights. When I don’t have insomnia and actually sleep, I’m left with a loss of interest in all aspects of my job. I go to work, struggle to do any actual work, go home, eat, and lay on the couch or in bed because I’m too exhausted to do anything else. My husband does all of the house work and it makes me feel so guilty. I have no interest in doing anything else and don’t care much about anything. 

My boss knows of my ptsd and insomnia and is so supportive, which I’m extremely grateful for. But I feel this life isn’t for me. I hate working 8-5 especially when I’m dealing with mental health issues and little sleep. I fantasize about quitting my job all the time. My husband works from home, which I wish I could do but can’t in my current position, so we could try to survive on one salary but it may be hard. We just moved into a new apartment and the rent is a little high for one salary, so I feel obligated to work full time. Does anyone else feel like this? Are you able to work full time and deal with your ptsd? I get the feeling that I may be better off finding a part time job while I go to therapy for my trauma and give myself space to actually deal with it. ";0

He did something a month ago sexually that completely broke me and my trust in him and just how I see him. I don’t want to be in the same house as him or touch him or have him touch me. 

Been staying with an understanding friend for a month off and on. Not even every night. Basement entrance, leave them alone. Just threw them 200 for the trouble. I think my friends partner has a problem with me but just pretends they don’t. Well just got the heads up I’m not welcome back. No reason given, really, but I think I get it.

222;222;1319_ptsd;"May be triggering, contains a bit of a rant - Do any of you have access to printables and PDF resources r.e PTSD, specifically flashbacks? Hi everyone. 

My PTSD is quite disabling already, but never like this. It has never really been addressed medically due to more pressing issues regarding my mental state, which arose way before the trauma did. 

I have been accepted for EMDR therapy though, and had my initial assessment a few days ago. I never talk about my trauma. I used to be able to get the flashbacks out of my head before they caused any real damage, I was really really good at running from it, blocking it out, and being in complete denial. I've struggled to leave the house lately, and have completely shut down, but NEVER have I suffered this badly from PTSD in eleven years. 

I took a bunch of Valium before the EMDR assessment appointment and let it all spill out, everything I could remember. That night, I had my first in depth, distressing, full on and unstoppable flashback attack that I had refused to let happen when it should have happened years ago. 

Full on pale, sweating, shaking, dissociated, banging my head to stop the visions kind of thing. Could hardly walk, thought I was dying. This has now happened two nights in a row. If it happens again tonight, I don't know how I'll cope. 

In the past, I've had a lot of issues with Valium, Xanax and Klonopin. I have stopped buying street Klonopin and Xanax, nobody will legally script them to me either. I've also stopped buying street Valium, but I still get it prescribed by any means necessary, and currently have a surplus from a script happy dentist. 

These days, I'm doing better with the benzos. Recently, I've had two small slips after almost a year sober from alcohol. But I'm terrified if it happens again soon, I will either get completely and utterly fucked up, or I might break completely. 

I've been having thoughts about refusing to drink any liquids and waiting to die, and it scares me, because I love control, I have to be in control all the time, and I am controlling enough of myself and others to be able to stick to dehydration as a method of ending my life. Obviously, I will sedate myself to within an inch of my life until I can see a mental health professional. 

But until then. I need something. A PDF of a workbook or popular self help book, resources that have helped any of you guys, printable. I'm so scared. And almost angry at myself for seeking treatment. Because although I can't bare living with such anxiety and avoidance, I also can't bare facing up to and reliving my trauma.

934;934;1915_ptsd;"Maybe PTSD? Okay, I'm gonna preface this by saying that sometimes I can be a hypochondriac, so there's a chance I'm overreacting.

My trauma comes from someone close to me attempting suicide, blaming it on me, and then continously blaming his suicidal feelings on me and saying he was thinking of killing himself and only telling me that and guilt tripping me when I tried to call him out on it.

My symptoms aren't severe, however, I've found myself avoiding the places where the catalyst for all of this happened, and I've had strange instances where I've had nightmares involving the catalyst playing out wordlessly, then turning into a fantasy situation of me running away. I can talk about it, but I will only talk about it if I'm the one who is in charge of the conversation.

But the worst that's happened is when I walked past that spot, as I need to to get home, I don't remember what happened except for a few splashes, which I remember as the guy who traumatised me. When I looked in car windows for my reflection, or thought, all I could hear were the words he said and all I could see was his reflection, and I could only picture myself as him.

My therapist said that it happens to a lot of people and that it's nothing to get caught up in, but should I push the possibility of maybe being a bit more traumatised than I've let on? I've only told her about the catalyst, and not everything about the catalyst.";1
590;590;1100_ptsd;"Medical PTSD - My Story I have begun to realize over the past couple of years that I have medical PTSD resulting from the treatment of a heart condition that I was born with. I have had various hospital appointments over the course of my life (now in my mid-twenties) as well as tests and a second surgery several years ago. I will require more of all of these in the future. Since I was a child I have had severe reactions when going to the hospital or even thinking about my condition and I would break down in tears as a child during appointments. I hate being touched and having to undress during appointments, I feel like I am being violated. My brain and body react to the doctors and nurses as if they were going to hurt me, I am physically and mentally terrified of even going near them and I am completely unable to consciously override this reaction. I cannot stand sounds, sights and smells that remind me of anything to do with my condition, and I will actively go out of my way to avoid them.    

 I have flashbacks where I involuntarily replay experiences in the hospital and similar nightmares several times per week. I've also had issues with malpractice, administrative errors and one doctor being almost emotionally abusive, deliberately exaggerating the severity of her condition so they could exercise power and authority over me as a terrified child. I've been diagnosed with a number of mental health conditions after short consultations with a GP - depression, anxiety, insomnia, health anxiety, social anxiety, but since becoming aware of the symptoms of ptsd and briefly seeing a therapist last year, it has become clear to me that undiagnosed ptsd is likely at the root of my problems.    

I feel like I am constantly in fight or flight mode, I can't calm down, slow down my breathing or untense my muscles because I have so much adrenaline flowing through my body all the time. I also think I'm seeing physical symptoms from being in this state for so much of my life - tiredness, poor concentration, autoimmune disorders, etc. I',m currently contacting therapists with experience working with ptsd to see if I can finally start to get a handle on this. For a long time I've struggled with feeling like my symptoms weren't legitimate, being told by doctors and my parents that I was just making it up for attention, I was a clever girl and I needed to stop messing around, that nothing was really wrong etc, all while my trust in people continues to get worse and I use substances to try and temper down my mental and physical reactions. I think by posting my story here I just want some sort of validation that my ptsd is real and valid, that I deserve help and treatment. I would really appreciate a conversation with anybody with medical ptsd, or anyone that can relate in general, feel free to DM me! Thank you for reading this small essay, it really means a lot to me.";1
2;2;102_ptsd;"Medical/illness related ptsd? So hey, this is something I've been thinking about a lot recently.  I'm diagnosed with depression, general anxiety and ocd and take medication.

I've been depressed since childhood but only sought help at age 20 because as a kid I was scared if any doctors knew cps would take me away (reports of kids with depression + my condition being wrongly perceived as a result of abuse) plus I didn't want to cause more pain to my family. . .  Then the secret had been kept too long to spill I guess.  I'd always been an anxious child too.

About 4 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar and on Quetiapine (Seroquel) until last summer. I do not have bipolar, the diagnosis was wrong (admitted by psych).

Since coming off the meds I've been re-experiencing symptoms that lead to my bipolar diagnosis. I'm now on 45mg of Mirtazapine but over the past week things have gotten very bad and I've had two mental health assessments at two different hospitals in the space of 3 days.

I have been feeling highly irritable, aggressive, very upset at times, I threatened someone with physical violence, acting reckless, drinking excessively and engaged in risky drug taking behaviour).

204;204;114_ptsd;"Meet the criteria for PTSD, but feel like what I experienced shouldn’t cause this much stress. I’m a 22 year old female. My mom has always had significant health issues and will likely die of her diseases, although when is not clear. This is something that causes me a lot of grief and distress but I have gotten good at compartmentalizing. 

A few months ago, we learned she had a heart murmur, most likely due to a heart condition that would require surgery. At the time I worked a stressful job and had been backstabbed by my company. (80 hour work weeks, lying boss.) he wouldn’t give me time off to care for her so I quit. Then we learned it was a mitral valve prolapse, and she definitely needed surgery. 

My mom has a personality disorder and has emotionally abused me at times throughout my life, especially when she’s stressed. So during this time she ostracized and bullied me, and banned me from going to the hospital for her surgery. 

In this time she kicked me out for 2 weeks. I stayed with two shitty people who did shitty things. I also got a horrible stomach virus (we all did) and got to a point where I thought I may need to get IV fluids. I have health anxiety so this was really hard for me. I ended up coming back after those 2 weeks. 

I got updates from my dad while she was hospitalized, there were a couple times it was touch and go and they thought it might be time to say goodbye, but she pulled through. Every night I was scared to sleep for fear that she would be dead when I woke up. Gradually I began eating and sleeping less, until one day, a couple weeks or so after her surgery, I didn’t eat or sleep for 3 days. Two doses of Ativan in the ER made no effect. I had a psychotic episode (I’m assuming?) that I don’t remember in which I physically fought the nurses and cussed out my friend. They gave me haloperidol and knocked me out. 

I was put in psych for 3 days in a terrible psych hospital where I received no therapy. The MD met with me once and said I have PTSD, but he thinks it’s from an experience I had as a teenager. 

Backstory on that: my freshman year of high school, I pissed a girl off and she and her friends cornered me and tried to beat me up. I don’t remember much of it, the adrenaline was in overdrive. The only mark on my body was a bleeding cut above my eye from being thrown onto a table. 

It was about 6 months after that that I began having constant panic attacks. Anxiety and depression deeply colored the next 4 years, as did benzo addiction. 

However, I never felt fear when I recalled the event. I had no flashbacks or nightmares. I didn’t avoid any reminders of the event. Basically, I didn’t fit any PTSD criteria, except the anxiety and hyper vigilance. 

Now, I fit the criteria for it. 

I avoid reminders of that time period from the time my mom kicked me out until I got out of the psych ward. 
I won’t watch tv because that’s all I did (unless I’m with someone) 
My house gives me anxiety because it reminds me of being there alone and afraid. 
I am terrified to sleep alone- I’ve only slept alone in my bed a handful of times since then and it’s always so scary to me that I cry if I have to do it. 
I feel empty and like my life will never get better, I can’t see a future. 
When I’m alone I am very afraid. 
I have a loss of identity. 
I feel disconnected to most people. 
I have panic attacks almost daily. 
I struggle to feel emotion, and when I do, I’m either sobbing or wanting to die or hurt myself, I imagine stabbing myself or slitting my wrists to satisfy the urge.

I've recently opened up, literally only a week or two ago, but now I've found out I'm pregnant with his baby. I dont even know what to do. I'm no where near old enough to have a baby, and my mental health is pretty unstable as of all that's happened. I'm having flashbacks 24/7, and though this has added to my problems, could talking about it make it EVEN more worse? I just have no idea what to do, to even think about this. Someone please help...

I'm 22/f, when I was around 7 years old during a custody battle between my father and mother, he was granted visiting rights to me and he constantly assaulted me for two years. By the time he lost visitation rights, I hadn't told anyone, and he went to prison overseas for something unrelated to me... He is back in the country now and I am constantly afraid of him... What's the point in pursuing it if I see in my country child murderers have gotten less than 10 years...?

By the time my mother found out, we never officially reported to the police, she grew up telling me to forget it, I was self harming, she couldn't understand why, I was extremely isolated, anxious and alone. I felt bullied by my mother at times, she is an emotional rollercoaster, even I can see that now... I have so much anger towards her now and she calls me every few days... She belittles my trauma, promotes mentally unhealthy ideas to me, makes me feel like she isn't my mother.

I am TIRED OF HER telling me that she did the best she could. BULLSHIT. By marrying a man you only knew for 3 months and letting this happen. I have worked so fucking hard over the past few years to get my mental health in check and she is holding me back, I haven't seen her since Christmas when she threw a temper tantrum because she didn't like her present.

She LOVES my brother. He has easily stolen 150k+ from her since teenagehood. He is 28, narcissistic cheater, and my mother let's his girlfriend who has been involved also in seuxal trauma (no secrets in my family) to be blindsided by my brother. I'm over it.

697;697;1688_ptsd;"Morning Panic Hey everyone, 

To give you some background, I use to work in a locked mental health facility for children and it wasn't the best run facility. I worked there a year and a half and I had my hair pulled, been spit on, punched, kicked, slapped, insulted, ect. There were periods of time where I would get hurt everyday at work for weeks. Not to mention hearing/seeing all the stories of what the kids went through and having to do ""therapeutic holds"" on children that are going through a mental health crisis.  I ended up leaving that job shortly after I got divorced and I have a great new job that is way lower stress/anxiety/trauma.

Well now here I am about a year later and every morning when I wake up I panic about having to go to work. I get so worked up I generally throw up every morning while getting ready for work and sometimes I have to pull over to throw up again. I have talked about this to my old therapist and I am finding a new therapist (just changed over insurance due getting a new job). I don't know what to do about this. The thing that has helped most is deep breathing exercises, but it usually takes me calming down on the hour drive to work to just get to a point where I can function. Any suggestions?";1
288;288;503_ptsd;"My abuser put me in a psych emergency hospital My ex was my abuser. She was manipulative and physically abusive and verbally controlling. When I broke up with her, she felt I had gone “crazy” (I use that term lightly because mental illnesses are not something to call crazy). After a fight she had caused between us, she manipulated my friend to signing an involuntary psych hold on me, in which I woke up to the police banging on my door to take me into the hospital. 
I can still feel the paper scrubs they made me strip down and change into. I was no longer a human being. I was their “PATIENT X”. No one knew where I was, not my parents, not my friends, no one. I was alone in a room with nothing the hide behind (aka suicide precautions). For 24 hours I stayed in that same room and those same paper clothes. 
I realized, I started zoning out (what some may call flashing back) to the times I was in the hospital. I can see my plates of food exactly as they were presented to me, the doctors faces, the pain one doctor inflicted upon touching my self harm injuries aggressively, despite knowing they were fresh. I hate this and I want to control it. I haven’t gone a single night in 2 months, 13 days without a nightmare of this experience and now it is starting to happen when I am awake.

457;457;179_ptsd;"My doc added Seroquel to my meds to help with my PTSD symptoms So I have PTSD, panic &amp; anxiety disorder, depression, and narcolepsy w/ cataplexy. I've been taking Effexor, gabapentin, and lamotrigine, but I've had worsening overarousal, hypervigilance, nightmares, and insomnia. 

I'm currently doing an intensive outpatient therapy program while I'm on medical leave. This is the first time in my life I've ever had therapy and it's really hard because talking about it (especially in a group setting) triggers so many painful memories and emotions that I've suppressed for 15+ years. I've been sleeping even worse than normal, which has worsened my daytime sleepiness. 

My doctor had recommended Seroquel a while back, but I refused because I read that it can cause weight gain and other problems. Well, I finally surrendered because I felt like I was going to have a psychotic episode if I didn't start getting  more sleep. 

Let me tell you, I only took 25mg last night and it mellowed me out. It was like somebody turned the volume down on the racing thoughts and anxiety about going to sleep. I was dead to the world! I'm still quite groggy today and dozing off randomly, but I forgot that I needed to take it earlier than 10pm. 

So we'll see how the rest of it goes. I will definitely need to keep a LOT of healthy snacks available, because I can already feel intense munchies in the making lol. Is anyone else taking it and do you have any advice? Thanks 😊";0

1171;1171;2419_ptsd;My family says my ptsd isn’t real, because the abuse wasn’t really and I’m so so screwed up. I feel like they never liked me, my mom and dad were so so mean to me. At least that’s how it felt to me. My parents had me when they were very young. My dad was a drug dealer and my mom was fifteen. I was a premature baby and since my parents were kids, my grandmother (my moms mother) was practically raising me a lot of the time. But my parents resented me for something they allowed to happen. They tried to make it so I couldn’t see her but when they wanted to go out well they would stop saying that. I would always get caught in the middle of their fights, glasses getting thrown, some even hit me, getting knocked over, getting screamed at for being in the room when they were fighting. And then it got worse. Whenever I tried to Hug my parents they’d either tell me to go away or they’d ask me what I wanted and push me out of the way. They’d tell me they never wanted me. They got older and when I was seven had another kid. And overtime three more. My parents stopped with the non legal stuff but they still constantly had their issues with each other, and whenever they didn’t get along they would take it out on me. I was grounded for months at a time for no reason, everything taken out of my room. Sometimes even locked in. And I was a pretty good child. I was just really sad. Just wanted a family. In middle school I tried really hard to get away. I went to the police and showed them the bruises told them of the horror I was living, but since I was in an upper class family they said I had it good and I should be grateful. I’m transgender which is another reason they just really didn’t like me. One time when I went to the police my mom threw herself into a cabinet and said I threw her, and I ended up having to go through the legal system as a very naive autistic innocent kid who wouldn’t hurt a fly. I was constantly just told I wasn’t wanted, pushed, hit, and when I ran away on my 18th birthday they made me feel like a monster for leaving. And the rest of my family says that it wasn’t abuse. That I had a good childhood. But I remember laying in my bed begging to either die or get another family. I don’t know;1

so i’ve opened up to my best friend about a lot over the years, and she always seemed pretty understanding of my trauma and everything. but in the past few months it really seems like she’s either forgotten that i went through severe trauma or just thinks it’s not that big a deal and i don’t really have ptsd. i first noticed it when we ran into my abuser and she seemed to warn me at first, but then told me to “stop being such a little bitch” when i started having a panic attack and wanted to leave the store. this just really got to me because i know she has been in almost the exact same situation and i did whatever i could to help her and get her out of there, but when it’s me i need to get over it so she can keep shopping for candy. something like this happened again when she tried to pressure me into going to a concert of someone who’s music severely triggers me and i straight out told her “i can’t do that it would severely trigger my ptsd”, but then she spent 10 minutes afterward trying to convince me to go because it’s her favorite singer and she doesn’t want to go alone. i just feel like she’s being completely selfish and expecting me to compromise my mental health so that she can have fun. i’m at the point where i just want to cut her off but i feel like i can’t do that without expressing my feelings at least once so here we are i guess. idk if i’ll tell her any of this because i’m really not looking to have a fight or talk shit out, at this point it’s pretty obvious to me that she doesn’t really respect me and repeatedly ignores one of my biggest struggles in life. i just can’t have a friend who i’m scared to hang out with because i think they’ll try and force me to stay in triggering situations and i definitely can’t have a friend who tells me to get over it after telling them everything i’ve been through.";1

542;542;621_ptsd;"My Intervention and Need for Insight **trigger warning for reference of rape**



Hi, so last night I was given an intervention by my new boyfriend, who believes that I have PTSD from a rape that happened several years ago. 
 I have been medically diagnosed with severe depression and an anxiety attack disorder.
This diagnosis came two years after I had been raped at the age of 16 and a virgin too nonetheless. 
At the time I felt as if I had no case so I didn’t report it to my family or the police. Since the attack I’ve struggled heavily with intimacy and trust in men. 
Now I’m 20 years old, a full time university student and far away from my attack but recently I’ve started to deal with some symptoms that I wasn’t used to with my current disorders.
 I’ve started to have nightmares sometimes daily about my attack. It happened in a wooded area very similar to the woods I have to walk through to reach my bus stop for school and I cannot stop dreaming about the men in my life cornering me in those woods. 
Combined with the nightmares I’ve had several episodes of a lover touching my back during sex and I think I had what’s considered a flashback although I’m not very sure. All I know is that it terrifies me. 
My boyfriend believes that I’m struggling with PTSD symptoms due to my attack but I don’t understand why I would have them now 4 years later?? 
Is that even possible? 
I would really appreciate some insight from those who have been diagnosed and wether or not you believe my symptoms hold cause for my to get tested.";1

I was processed out of the United States Navy, 13 years ago, on a medical discharge. 

***Honorable Discharge: but cannot reenlist*** 

I felt like a failure. 
Like a loser. 
Like I was weak and inadequate. 
I felt as though I had let my family down, disgraced them even... 

I had mental instability that I had not yet found a clear, succinct reason for. I had anger, bitterness, resentment, distrust, anxiety, depression, and so much more. 

I was overwhelmed and undiagnosed. 

Over the course of the next 7 years; I was misdiagnosed: 
-bipolar (manic-depressive)
-borderline personality disorder 
-acute generalized depression 
-chronic depression  
-obsessive compulsive disorder 
-panic disorder 
-generalized anxiety disorder 

 I was prescribed a few different medications to treat these misdiagnosed conditions.

SURPRISE! Nothing worked. 
Well... Paxil worked, but I felt lifeless... 
Zombie-ish, even. 

I myself had never even considered PTSD as a diagnosis, because: 

1) I, like so many people, thought PTSD was something WAR vets got. 
2) I'm neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist; so, I blindly figured my case was cut and dry amd that if I was diagnosed with something -- it was what I actually suffered from. 

Never in a million years would I have guessed that so many mental illnesses, developmental disorders,  (and learning disabled even) had various overlapping symptoms, that made it quite difficult for even the most knowledgeable Mental Health physicians to properly diagnose. 

Then I saw an article on Facebook about victims (I prefer the term SURVIVORS) of sexual assault/ trauma having PTSD. 

This was my AH HAH moment, and I felt giddy with anticipation of possibly being properly diagnosed; once and for all. 

I repeatedly mentioned to my Dr. ALL of the symptoms I had been experiencing, and also made a point to express concern that I might have PTSD, while trying to remain respectful of my Doctor's advice and years of study and experience in the field. 

It took a couple years BUT I was tentatively diagnosed with PTSD and my meds were replaced with an antipsychotic and a sleeping pill. 

This latest change in medicine seemed to work on my most worrisome symptoms -- HOWEVER, one of the meds made my face, arms, and hands constantly tingle while the drug was still in my system. 
Which, btw, made it difficult if not impossible to fall asleep. 

I once again went back to the Dr., my antipsychotic was changed, and I was also given an antihistamine that was supposed to help me fall asleep faster. 

The hope was to get me to fall asleep, stay asleep, and NOT have night terrors. 

While falling asleep was easier now, staying asleep was NOT, because the dreams persisted. 

I've since then added an indica/sativa marijuana blend to my medicine regime, to help with sleep. 

Some nights, I forget to smoke, and I have terrible night terrors. 

Other nights; I smoke and feel okay. On those nights, I sleep deeper and less fitfully; HOWEVER, I still have weird dreams. 

Smoking MJ has reduced the incidences of me waking up screaming and/ or crying, and shaking. 

There are still nights where I end up waking up from the vivid horrors in my dreams, and stay up, with all the lights on. 

I'm a work in progress. ";1

Once I messed up my solo for a competition and couldn't get back to class. I was crying and ashamed. He kissed me on the cheek. It was nonconsentual. He told me not to make a big deal about it. 

I didn't think about it until recently. I wanted to become a school teacher like him. Found a blog and accounts of sexual abuse from other female students over the last 30-something years. They called him out. Corraborating accounts of numerous assaults and inappropriate conduct.

He's dead now. I'm still trying to process things. I should've tried. I should've reported.  It might've stopped the cycle then, instead of growing up thinking that was normal.

I never told my parents (that I remember, it happened when I was 5-6 and my parents have always treated me like a dramatic liar so maybe I did tell them and forgot)

Last year (I was 25 or 26) my mother told me that when I was a child I used to be happy and curious and full of life, and that it suddenly changed ""for no reason"". I have no memories of ever having been anything other than a sad, sometimes angry child. She can be quite abusive emotionally so I'm not really sure what she wanted me to take away from that, it felt a little accusatory like she believes 5 year-old-me decided to become bitter just to flex on her.

It reminded me of when I was 13 and I went to a doctor for my insomnia. After talking with her and testing a few things she wanted to talk to my parents so they came with me to the next appointment. he told them that there seemed to be no physical problem but from our conversation she could tell that I probably needed therapy. My father basically told her that I was a dramatic idiot who made things up for attention and we left.

Now the trauma is resurfacing, new memories are coming and I can barely function. Not to mention the added trauma of having grown up without effective coping mechanisms and the abusive relationship I got into and stayed into because I didn't know I was a human being who deserved to be treated as such. I'm so angry and I can't stop thinking about where I would be now if they had allowed me to get help 14 years ago, or better yet 22 years ago when they noticed something had drastically changed.

768;768;1603_ptsd;"My Partner has Disassociative Flashbacks and Runs Off - Need Tips Hello,

I'm new here but I have been looking for some help with this for a while and I thought I would try to see if someone from this community might be able to help. 

We are in the process of getting her to see a psychiatrist and start therapy, but until the medical insurance clears we can't do that. Until then, she has a habit of running off when she flashes back. When she does that she's sometimes in her PJs or without her phone. When that happens she ends up waking up lost and cold. She has also occasionally self-harmed while in a flashback. 

Due to all of these concerns, I would very much like to equip her with a GPS so that when she runs off I can find her quickly and bring her home ASAP. Does anyone have any tips on what kind to get? Or, perhaps some other tips about either other ways to deal with this or anything else. I am always open to suggestions. I just want what's best for her and for her to get through these rough episodes as quickly and as easily as possible.

Thank You.";1
113;113;1113_ptsd;"My psychologist has confused me, I “endorse symptoms of PTSD”... help me out here I was diagnosed with severe high functioning anxiety at a young age as well as OCD and depression. My family and I took care of it through therapy and I managed to get on top of my mental illnesses for quite some time. In my adulthood, I was deteriorating so I eventually sought out a new psychologist. She has officially diagnosed me with “Major depression and Generalized anxiety” which I wasn’t surprised with. However, I’m posting here because she told me that I endorse all the symptoms of PTSD, but she and I couldn’t pick out a trauma that it could have come from, there for she couldn’t diagnose me with PTSD. 

So I’m just utterly confused because how does one “endorse” symptoms of something like this? I’ve been trying to search the web to see if any psych journals could help me out but basically I’ve only found things that tell me that this means I technically HAVE ptsd. 

Idk, if someone could share an experience of this language being used with them or what it might mean, it could be really helpful.

469;469;597_ptsd;"My therapist doesn't believe in diagnoses, and I feel like it's keeping me from getting treatments and accommodations. Heads up - most likely triggering. 

Hi Reddit! Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.

I've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs. The problem is that my current primary therapist (seeing her for a year) doesn't believe in diagnoses. She believes I'm able to get past everything that has happened so I can function like a ""normal"" person. She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. 

Am I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? 

TL;DR:
Severe C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled. Am I overreacting or do I need to find a new therapist?";0

1064;1064;2534_ptsd;"My toxic relationship with my dad is still affecting me As a young girl, my father was always hard on me... a little more than my brother. Always strict with my grades (understandable), but he also had a control problem. He always had to control everything relating to my family, even controlled my mother to the point where she wasn’t allowed to spend any money from her own paycheck or wear any makeup to work. He was also emotionally &amp; mentally abusive to her, and emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive to my brother &amp; I on a daily basis (again, I always got it more than him). 

When I was a sophomore in high school, I was 5’5” and a healthy 135-140 lbs. I was a small in tops and about a 6 in jeans, so I was never really considered fat or even overweight, just healthy. During this year, my dad became weirdly obsessed with my weight. He would force me to run and do at home exercises daily, he would also weigh me about once a week. Now, don’t get me wrong, I feel like if I were the slightest bit overweight/unhealthy then maybe he could of approached differently, like suggesting to eat better or maybe join him in some of his workouts. But no, I wasn’t overweight and he FORCED me to workout. By my senior year of high school his obsession grew even grater. He was weighing me every morning and making me do more intense workouts to lose weight. I ended up weighing 117 lbs by the middle of my senior year. I was so skinny that I looked unhealthy, my collarbones would pop out. I wouldn’t eat much around friends because I was afraid that if I did eat like a normal person, I’d gain weight so I just told my friends excuses like I wasn’t hungry or I had already eaten earlier. They would always tell me that I was too skinny and if everything was okay with me. I would end up telling my parents and my dad would respond with “they say that because they are jealous.” 

If I didn’t weigh 117 lbs every morning- for example, if I weighted the SLIGHTEST bit over 117, like 117.4 lbs then he’d take my phone away for the day, it would also cause him to get mad at me for gaining an extra 0.4 lbs which would usually end up in a verbal fight and then him hitting me (at 18 years old- and even though I was technically 18 he still controlled everything in my life... my phone, the money that I made at my part time jobs, my car).  I would only get my phone/car/friend privileges back if I weighed 117 lbs the next day. Weeks would go by and I would be stuck at 118-119 lbs, and even though I was doing all the workouts he made me do and barely eating, my weight would fluctuate, especially during my time of the month. So I would go weeks without my phone even though I was driving from school to work/cheerleading practice, so if something were to happen while I was driving I had no way of calling for help. 

I remember not having a phone to take pictures with my friends on graduation day because I weighed the slightest bit over 117. This obsession continued into my freshman year of college when he forced me to live at home and commute to still have every bit of control over me. So, it was another year of weighing me every morning, physical &amp; emotional abuse if I didn’t weigh what he wanted me to. I remember one day weighing 120 lbs and he looked at me like he was disgusted by the 3 pounds I had gained and called me fat, and would point out and say that my legs were already bigger from the day before even though I physically still looked the same, but my weight would change because, like I said, it is normal for your weight to fluctuate a couple of pounds. This minor change in weight could be cause by lots of things like retaining water. This continued up until the July before I started my sophomore year of college. 

That July, he was mandated to leave my house because him and my mom were fighting and he hit her in the face and she told me to call the police, so I did. When he was getting escorted out by the police, I remember him turning to me and saying “you’re the devil. I hate you.” But what else was I going to do? He literally HIT my mom in the face, let alone the lifetime of physical abuse he caused to my brother and I. Fast forward 4 years.... I live with my mom, and my dad and I have a rocky relationship. I love him because he’s my dad. I know he’s always wanted the best for me but due to his narcissistic and controlling ways, he’s had an awful way of showing it. I suffer from diagnosed anxiety, depression and PTSD from my childhood up until my early adult years. He still hasn’t apologized for anything that he’s done, nor realizes that he’s the main reason I have those disorders. I’ve tried to tell him repeatedly that what he did and what he continues to do is not right (no physical abuse anymore, just emotional and mental), including making me feel guilty for things or bad about myself. He also blames everyone else for getting arrested the day he hit my mother. I don’t know what else to do to help him change or to at least recognize what he’s been doing has truly damaged me. Every time I notice that he’s trying to be a better person and try to mend the relationship with me, a fight happens and the unhealthy cycle starts again.";0

502;502;658_ptsd;"My work is threatening to fire me Hi everyone, 

To keep a long story short, my supervisors at my work (state bureaucratic job) called me into a meeting on Friday and let me know that they were considering firing me this week once my 6 month probation period is up because, essentially, I don’t socialize enough with my co-workers. I explained to them during the meeting that my PTSD, which I’ve told them about before , saps a lot of my mental energy and I am constantly battling anxiety attacks and flashbacks, etc., throughout the workday, which is very mentally and emotionally draining, and leaves engaging in small talk with others quite difficult for me. I’ve never been rude or disrespectful to anyone at my job, and I’ve never turned in sub-par work as a result of my difficulty socializing (they agreed with this). I simply don’t engage in small talk like some of my other co-workers do. However, my supervisors did not care when I explained all of this, and said that they simply have to fill out the “objective forms” that indicate whether or not I’m qualified for the job, and that my introverted behavior makes them have reservations. I don’t know what to do at this point, but I’m feeling really mistreated, and I am about to head into this work week fully expecting it to be my last. Thank you for reading, I just needed to vent to an understanding community because obviously our society still has problems recognizing the seriousness of our disability.";0
160;160;481_ptsd;"Need advice on dating a girl with ptsd Crossposting here from r/mentalhealth

Without getting too into her past experiences, she was emotionally abused and made to do sexual favors, and then stalked by the human garbage. This happened about 4-5 years ago and she sill has trust issues and emotional issues because of it. I am new to relationships, I've only had one long term relationship before this for two years and it ended abruptly and suddenly. Because of that I also am insecure with relationships and I was not sure if she actually liked me for a while. She does but she has a hard time showing it, and I've accepted that because I really like her. She has a hard time expressing herself to me which is fine but a little frustrating because I don't have much of a filter and I say what I feel to her.

She refuses to get help. She won't see a therapist and she won't take medication because she doesn't want to depend on it her whole life. She saw a therapist initially but it made the anxiety and depression worse leading to a suicide attempt, so she won't try again. I keep telling her she needs to talk to someone if not me, or try meds but she won't budge. 

Also, occasionally she will get very defensive with me about seemingly very random things, which does tend to lead to fights because it makes me upset and then she gets upset because of that. What should I do when this happens? She also never apologizes for doing it, which is also a little frustrating because it makes me feel bad, like I did something to upset her(enter, insecurity). 

 All of this being said, I have a few questions.

How do I help her get help? What can I do?

Will she ever open up to me? I see glimpses of her true self every now and then but I want to know everything about her, and it's frustrating that I can't.

If anyone would like to share experiences of dating someone with ptsd I'd love to hear them. Or if you suffer from ptsd I'd love to hear firsthand about these questions or the troubles we are having. I really want to make this work and I do really like her. Besides all of this, she really Is my dream girl and I find her incredibly attractive.

831;831;2562_ptsd;"Need advice on finishing internship while dealing with PTSD and anxiety Though Im still hesitant in saying I have PSTD it pretty much looks like it. Yesterday I went to see my psychologist and she agreed it would be best to treat traumas I got from my previous relationship with EMDR, which we are starting next week.

Im not here to talk about my past but I need some practical advice. Im a student in the last month of my (paid)internship and I have been feeling guilty about calling in sick a lot. My supervisors are very understanding and kind, thats why I was able to keep up the work most parts of the months. 

But now Im really struggling with the last straws. I have a paper due and it is stressing me out. Usually I called in sick once every two weeks or worked from home once a week because getting out of my house in the morning gave me anxiety. I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up. Maybe I just need someone to tell me you know its okay to call in sick, you dont have to feel guilty your working on yourself and thats whats most important. I self lack this view because I mostly dont consider myself helpworhty, which is another problem on its own. 

I already contacted my mentor from school yesterday. The last time we spoke she told me I could figure it out with the internship company if I knew what would work for me. Problem is, I dont know what works for me. Each day is different. Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go. So I feel like it would give me some rest if I gave myself time to work on this paper or going to the internship part time. That way everyone knows what to expect from me instead of just seeing if I will be able to show up everyday. 

On the other hand, over the holidays when I had some time off I felt awful. I really dont like being on my own all day and had a lot anxiety that I had to show up for work the next week. So being at home all the time didnt work out that well. 
I never called in sick for a longer than a day in the past because the pressure to show up and fear of losing my job or getting kicked out of school. But thats what is getting back to me now cause I dont have a healthy view on how to get better.




As you see Im constantly questioning myself, I just dont know what would be appropriate for someone in my situation. How do you guys handle this stuff? What do you do to get productive and how do you handle the stress of a deadline when there is so much going on in your head? Have you taken a longer time of work to deal with your mental health and how did that work out?

Thank you so much for reading this, I am very new to all this and its a bit of a thing for me to ask advice cause it means admitting I need help. Which would be okay for someone else, I just feel ashamed about the whole situation, its not a walk in the park you know..

TLDR: Gonna start PTSD (EMDR) therapy and dont know if or how I can finish my internship. Need some advice on how others deal with the aspect of jobs and expectations.

309;309;1059_ptsd;"Need Advice: GF with severe PTSD and Roommates My girlfriend of (almost) 3yrs has PTSD, extreme anxiety, and deals with pretty severe depression. After 2yrs, I finally got her to a doctor so she could start an anti-depressant regiment. I didn’t just push her to do it, thinking it would change everything. When we began dating, we had known each other for a few months (work), and anxiety was apparent. I learned of her PTSD and Depression shortly into the relationship. I deal with depression myself, so I wasn’t about to give up on someone for things they can’t control. I was clear with her of my goal for her in our relationship: to be happy and healthy.

Her family life is almost non existent, and she has moved around most of her life. She severed ties with (some of) the abusive relationships in her life about 2 years ago. We moved in together because we spent most of our time together and we wanted to save money. It’s been almost 2 years living together (after only 8-10 months of dating). Cracks are beginning to show.

We have two roommates, who I like very much. She always got along with them until recently. Our apartment is 2 couples, M-F / M-F. It’s a two bedroom, so yes, it gets a little cramped, even though its a big place, one bathroom is a constant pest. 

Lately (past 6 months), the girl living with us has made it clear about keeping things clean, using our own appliances.. usual passive-aggressive roommate stuff. I’m used to it, I do NOT take it personally from the girl, we still chat in a very friendly way frequently, and I’m good friends with her boyfriend. I see these grievances as small troubles, roommates setting boundaries, etc.

We have lived with this couple for the entirety of us living together. Problems just started to arise about 6 months ago. The girl would get pissed at messy bathroom, moldy stuff in fridge, etc. NEVER became vocal about these problems. Began to show some passive aggressive behavior: Slamming bathroom door, leaving notes, sending TWO texts, JUST TWO over a few months.

I see this stuff as normal, my girlfriend is losing her mind. The slamming of bathroom doors led to her having flashbacks of her shitty father. I spoke with the roommate, and explained the situation. It stopped happening. The girl asked that my GF start using her own electric kettle due to overlapping morning schedules. My GF’s electric kettle was given to her by one of her attackers at her last apartment. That was hard to explain to girl, so we gave it away to avoid more triggers for my girlfriend.

Now, my girlfriend is being triggered by the girl loudly doing her own dishes. This, I had to make a stand on. They were not my gf’s dishes. She had no dogs in the fight. Yet she blamed her INCREDIBLE anger where she stormed into our room and stayed for the night, on loud dish-doing. 

My girlfriend is not a clean person. I can deal with it, try to get her to clean, but it is not my roommates’ fault that she is this way. 

The girl left a note on a tupperware container tonight saying ‘PLEASE DISPOSE’ and my girlfriend lost it. Inside? A month of veggie smoothie mix that had a lump of mold in it so large that I couldn’t wash it down the sink, I had to pick it out and trash it.

My girlfriend? Threw a fit and LEFT IT OUT on the counter. Walked away from it. Meanwhile the moldy cup in the living room I asked her to clean will start a fight if I bring it up. 

The note? She wrote 'FUCK OFF' on it, then threw it away out of regret(?). Left it for me (I guess?) to clean, like everything else.


This escalation between the girl and my GF is getting out of hand. We are moving in 6months. I believe that my GF is overreacting and its unnecessary anger, stress, and confusion adding to the situation. 

I have stood by my GF for almost 3 years. I have read about PTSD, slowly pushed her towards treatment (finally got her to the Dr for anti-depressants, she hadn’t been to a Dr in many many years). I have tried (slowly) to get her to therapy.. we made a few appointments that she canceled (a while ago). 

I feel like my GF isn’t trying. She is being overloaded. She is also being selfish and rude when that is in NO WAY the person I knew years ago. I have been patient with her conditions. I have tried nothing but to help her. I have made stands on some things (almost exclusively cleaning, especially our room that looks like a disaster area, due to her). I’m approaching the end of my rope. Completely ignoring me begging her for years to clean, explaining that it stresses me out the way her triggers do, is starting to really piss me off and make me feel like she doesn't care about my happiness if it means an ounce of work for her. 

**TL;DR** My GF is freaking out over my roommate’s recent actions. I believe it is a completely irrational response. I have taken triggers into consideration, but believe she is being selfish and closing off. I have tried to help her as much as possible, but I have my fears that if this is how she acts now, what will our future (on a different coast we’re moving to) hold. That fear has me questioning our future, viability, health, etc.

Any input would help. I can’t possibly say I fully understand PTSD, but I have tried for years to help her, and plan to continue. I feel insensitive when claiming a trigger or her anxiety in certain situations if irrational, but I truly feel this has been. I can give more specifics about her PTSD. Apologies for throwaway, want to protect her privacy. 

Thanks

667;667;2047_ptsd;"Need help So about two years ago I had a manic episode and was restricted to an psychiatric hold for 42 days. It’s been a rough two years since filled with antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs and I’m looking towards psychotherapy and any advice for help. My ultimate goal is to return to my life medication free. I am scheduled to meet with a psychotherapist this Thursday, so letting everyone know that I’m taking the next steps to better myself already.I will get into my symptoms down below but wanted to start out with a bit of background

I had my intital outburst in a scientific laboratory. I was working really hard towards my masters degree and studying for my mcat when I lost my shit basically. I wasn’t honest with my advisor about how much I thought the work was pushing me to my limits and wasn’t taking my mental health as a priority. I became paranoid believing my colleagues and friends were out to get me. I stayed up for three days without sleep and I had an extreme accident when could have blinded me with scientific materials from the lab. From my stay in the psychiatric hold, my family visited me but they held me for so long because I couldn't come to about all my paranoid thoughts. Eventually, they did die down with the medication and I never saw any hallucinations or voices. I was diagnosed with Bipolar.

Since then, I am quite functional in everyday life. I don't get out of the house much and my social life is lame, and I also don't have a girlfriend. I have a job now but I do still have a few symptoms that I wish would be relieved. I am easily reminded of people from my old work setting and I think things have hidden meanings sometimes. At my worst, I actually thought I was communicating telepathically with a secret society because they wanted my intellectual value in their recruitment. I'll have ideas of reference where I believe people in public are specifically talking about something associated with me.

I think a lot of my issue is that I’m critical of people and critical of myself. I know that it could be underneath all this that I have low self esteeem and maybe that I even didn’t have enough confidence in myself to do the work that I was doing before my accident.

Am I even more out there to think that this sort of paranoia will sustain ever? I've been medicated which makes me think this is not a biological problem but rather a psychological one. I believe that with the right help and my own willpower that I can overcome my past and lead the life I want to live. I feel like if I were to socialize more and even get a girlfriend that my life would be better and less stressful.

Also, what should I expect from the psychotherapist? Will it be one of the therapist who believe medicine is the answer or one like some of my previous therapists that think I can overcome this without medication. I wanted to try psychotherapy mainly because of Jordan B Peterson and is youtube videos I've watched. Plus, I didn't feel that much of a connection and want to be picky if I'm paying to talk to somebody.";0

 I am now 20 and freak out when i see cop cars and I often have dreams of the police arresting and my friends taking me or us to jail or raiding my house. I even hate hearing the sirens in songs and i especially hate seeing a combo of red and blue lights. I often wake up from those dreams completely out of breath and sometimes crying and very scared until I realized it was a dream. This is all embarrassing for me. 

Do people with ptsd have these similar experiences or am I over reacting to having night mares slightly often? Maybe everyone is afraid of seeing cops? I just would like everyones opinions on if they think I have a problem or not and what kind of professional I should talk to. I am sorry but I know nothing about any of this. I have been considering seeing a dr. for this. I have never posted anything on reddit and I am sorry if this is not what this is for.";1
149;149;1349_ptsd;"Need somewhere to vent, can't talk to my therapist Tw: rape, sexual abuse nsfw Some asshole tried to tell me even though 70% of  rapes aren't reported that every woman who is raped and doesn't report is either lying because she cheated or is irresponsible for letting the man walk free and rape others.

Usually comments like these I just roll my eyes at but today it became a huge trigger. My mind went back to my ex and everything he did and for the first time in 4 years since it happened I realized I was raped. I've been lying to myself, making excuses for him, rewriting the memories in my head, trying to find any way around that word. I would say ""sexual abuse"" and ""coersion"" to minimalize what happened. ""he loved me, he didn't realize what he was doing was wrong"". This morning I suddenly remember the probably hundreds of conversations I had telling him no means no and that it wasn't ok what he was doing. He acknowledged, apologized, then said I was just too irresistible and he can't control himself at all when he's turned on, it isn't him, his dick is the one in full control.

Post break up he was desperate to have his victim back. When to great lengths, more than he ever did in the almost 2 years we were together. He did something nice I was extremely grateful for then he sat himself outside my door until I let him come ""cuddle"". He swore he wouldn't try anything, he just wanted some cuddles. I had been up for 48 hrs, anxiety was at a high, I had no strength. He stayed outside begging me for an hour, keeping me awake, until I gave in. I passed out quickly to wake up to him trying to have sex with me. I pretended I was asleep and prayed for it to stop and it never did. He then kissed me on the forehead like it was a consensual thing he did. I'm still pretending to be asleep.

For years I have lied to myself on this situation. I minimalized, excused, told myself he was young and didn't know better (we were 17-18 at the time), anything to make it not happen. I've checked on his social media ever since to make sure he hasn't been dating anyone. He still tries to twist the whole relationship like he wasn't a great bf but we had some great times.

I'm married and in a healthy relationship with someone who respects my boundaries and I constantly worry he's going to do it someone else.

It's just really hard when your brain finally shows you the truth after hiding it for so long.. I remembered what he said but had warped what i told him just to make myself feel like he just didn't understand or know. But he did. He knew. He understood what he was doing. I sat and broke down countless times and he would say his magic words then repeat the cycle.

Sorry for the long ass story, I just.... It took me 2 years to admit the sexual abuse, and another 2 for this.. I'm still having a really hard time saying the word out loud because if I do it solidifies it so I guess I'm typing it out as a next best thing. Thank you for reading this, I just needed a safe place to get my thoughts out until I can see a professional today or tomorrow 

Tldr: thank you asshole that invalidated and victim blamed the 70% of women who don't report for making it click in my head that what my ex did went past sexual abuse and he raped me and he knew what he was doing.";1

**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of your night/morning and have a wonderful week. &lt;3";1
696;696;2413_ptsd;New to this. (Sorry if this is scattered thoughts bundled together) Long story short— I had a car accident about 8 months ago. I had to be airlifted. I only remember hearing the sounds of the helicopter and I don’t remember anything beyond that besides waking up in a hospital with a tube down my throat begging for water that I couldn’t drink for 3 days. I arrived to the hospital with just enough blood to be breathing still. I fractured my pelvis, broke my ankle on the opposite side of my body, and broke my elbow on the the same side of my fractured pelvis. I couldn’t walk for 3 months and I was in a retirement/ rehabilitation facility for 3 weeks after being in ICU for 2 weeks after my accident where the “nurses” and doctors there had never dealt with someone as young as me. It was hell in there and finally I was able to go home and be bed bound then wheelchair accessible then  I began to walk again after a lot of physical therapy~October, my accident was early July. Well I felt like those times there was so many crazy things going on it hasn’t been until now where Im returning to a somewhat normal lifestyle (attempting at least) where Ive started to go through what I can only describe as panic attacks, insomnia, and nightmares. The panic attacks started about a month ago. And just simply thinking about being job less and just how different my life has changed to what it is now causes a huge influx of negative thoughts and I just dont want to leave the house and deal with life. I dont feel like Im myself anymore like the old me died in that accident. I wanted to get out of my bed for so long when I was bed bound that now I recluse in it because of the anxiety. I am currently taking pain pills a much lesser dose then I started with. I started attending group classes and a lot of the time I get told I need to be more honest with myself and accept that what happened was traumatic and I tend to down play it most of the time I talk about it. I just wanted to let you guys in on this because it was this subreddit that convinced me to attend a group therapy in the first place. ;0

I’ve been dealing with PTSD for a little over a year now.

Now I'm off again and don't have anything that's in my face saying I need to get back on it but I'm just not sure.  The main changes I've noticed in the past month have been:

1135;1135;1634_ptsd;"Not sure if PTSD, but having nightmares two years later... Throwaway account. 

So, this is a reallllyyyy long story, but about two years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy who I found out was lying to me and who I'm pretty certain was manipulating me. (Despite his mom and friend telling me he was manipulative and that I should stay away.) Anywho, he was very mentally ill and seeking counseling, but I think he should've gone to a residential treatment facility. Alas, he was in his twenties and no one could force him. 

Anyways, I have nightmares about seeing him now and I wake up feeling so panicked and anxious for a while. He would get into these extreme rages after fights with his mom, and he once told me he wanted to kill her. I was horrified, but he was acting very different than normal, so I talked him out of it. 

We eventually went our separate ways and he lives very far away from me, but I still fear he will find me and hurt me, tho he never made any kind of threat against or was even mean to me. But I don't trust him at all. He also has a relationship with a new girl (she looks similar to me and his past girls in several ways, creepy) and honestly just the thought of it makes me sick. 

Oh, and the story is worse, considering he went thru basically a psychotic break and for a couple of weeks I thought he would kill himself, but I won't get into it. 

I'm in a happy relationship now with a man that I trust very much and who is incredibly kind, so I know I am safe. I just hate that I still deal with these dreams and fears. I honestly don't want to talk to a counselor about it because it's not even a situation I like to talk about with close friends. It makes me feel that horrified inside.";1

I haven't got anywhere yet, and this is tough, just trying to ventilate something.  


I'm in my early 20s, I'm a male, I live in Europe and I have a girlfriend that tries to support me.  
I am struggling today with studies, my everyday mental state and doing what I think is required of me. But I don't seem to be able to carry all of it and sometimes it comes crashing down at me. I end up crying and downwards spiraling in my thoughts. I have trouble remembering stuff, I have trouble concentrating and it doesn't feel like I will ever get to where I want to be. I'm afraid, scared and it seems that I have gotten used to the feeling of it that I don't even notice anymore. My head is failing me and it was one of my best qualities about myself.  


I grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too. We were poor, there never was a ray of sunshine because new clouds of shit always came around.   


My earliest memories is me running from home, because my mother yelled at me to do so - because my dad was going to beat her. She told me to run to my aunt and make her call the police. I remember running, but not arriving there.  


I became the quiet kid, the kid that tried to fix everything and not cause any trouble. But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  
I had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either. I remember being in school, and people were complaining about things that seemed like nothing but I never could tell anyone.  


I remember feeling so horribly sad, and I went to talk with my mother. And she was high on the pills, because she said she saw angels but it was just light flashes from the cars driving by our window. And that hurt so much.  
I was crying and she didin't take care of me.   


When I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother. Everytime they came around, they always brought problems home. Always turned to a scream-fest and me being stuck infront of my PC - hoping that they don't come here.  


I never got beaten by my dad, but my dad beat everyone else. ( I can't remember how severe it was, but I don't think that anyone got hospitalized. ) And my mom told me that I should feel glad/lucky that he never did, because I was his son.  


I finally got to meet a therapist, I cried and did what I thought was nessecary to get past this.  
But it won't let me go, I just want to be healthy and be a normal person. I want to stop crying everyday, I want to feel good enough and not being so fucking pitiful. I was so strong, I thought.  


Then I tried cannabis, and I realised that not all drugs are bad and.. It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.  


Then.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze. I took some punches, told the truth and they wanted to beat someone else now.  
 (But it backfired in two hours and they wanted to meet me and prob beat me more.)  


When I left, I was glad that I had not pissed myself or started crying. But my head was racing, I had never been so alert in my life. Adrenaline.  
I did not realise that.. That was probarly the beginning of my PTSD. I became paranoid, I moved 2 days after that.  


7 months later, I was in the military. I was not forced, but I thought it was a good idea and a nice life experience.  
2,5-3 months in, it hit me. I started flinching, I started dreaming nightmares, I became dull in my head, I once grappled with a dude and.. I became so furious, and he had to hold me because, if he had let me go earlier than he did. I maybe would have done something rash. ( I can get angry, but I -never- act on it.. I did when I was a teen, but very rarely. )  


I had to drop out, I felt that I was a failure. I came back to my country where I was born. (Neighbour country.)  
I started living with my GF and.. That is where everything turned to shit.  


I have stopped crying while writing, so that's nice. But I must have been occupied.. Less than a hour, but more than 20 minutes.   


I have forgot to mention so much. Such as, I stopped being happy after the military. My symptoms worsened.  
I did not know what was wrong with me back then, now I do.  
It felt like I was at fault, but I know now that it's just a illness or whatever you may call it.   
(English is not my primary language.)

  
I'm going to talk to a therapist again, I'm waiting for a call. (Within 10 days.)  
I try to be transparent how I feel with my GF but it's hard and sometimes I want to just fight it through without her help, because I don't want to take even more from her than she already gives me.

  
I found this sub yesterday, I was looking for a place to ventilate. I can't keep crashing and crying infront of my awesome girlfriend, I -must- get better because I don't want to lose her. (She really is the best, my gf during military cheated twice. Nice.) Anyhow, I read a post and.. The person writing felt the same way I did, I could see myself in several other posts, people who have it better or worse. And I felt glad, that I'm not crazy and you people also feel like I do.  
I know, it's f\*\*ked up but thank you for feeling like this and thank you for sharing!";1
724;724;1918_ptsd;"NSFW Back at square one, feeling lost. Just a warning that this post deals with triggering and graphic subjects! 


Hey, I'm 16 and have been dealing with PTSD since 2014 and just recently relived a very similar event and caused me to lose all my progress. Feeling lost and have no clue what to do anymore.

Back in 2014 on christmas eve I saw a man get shot and killed while shopping for a ring for my mother. I was about 11 or 12 at the time and just didn't really know how to cope or understand it so I blocked it out until around 2017 when I accepted the fact that I did/do have PTSD and tried to acknowledge and work with it more. Before then I had been diagnosed with PTSD twice but chose to ignore it, even though I would constantly have nightmares and dealt with pretty bad insomnia along with paranoia. 

I'm currently in a tiny RV park in the fucking desert and just recently had to listen to a guy getting shot to death two RVs down from my own. It destroyed any progress I had previously made and I don't even know where to go from here anymore. Ever since then I've been waking up at 2-3am because of nightmares, I constantly feel so fucking numb and on edge, it's fucking terrible. His RV is still right there and everyday I look out the window and just see it there. I feel guilty for being so affected by it because my dad saw the body and is holding it together, I can't imagine how the victim's family feels.

I can't even remember how I really started to recover from the first event, I understand that the recent event is still extremely fresh but I just hate that I have to do this all over again. Life will be life, though. Shit happens and people are still just as cruel and senseless as they've always been.
 There's many more aspects to the murder that I'm scared to open up about that are also causing me issues but all I can say is that the victim won't get justice, the system in the tiny town I'm at is fucked and corrupted. 


I just really needed a place to let this out at for now until I am able to figure out whatever else I can do to help myself. As much as I hate it, I think I'll have to just give myself time.";1
606;606;709_ptsd;"NSFW Missing Gap in My Memory So, I have this gap in my memory from when I was around 7-8 years old. My parents have filled in the more significant parts of the gap, but most of it is totally lost to time minus a trip I took that I only remember because I threw up on a stuffed tiger that I kept by me at all times and it got a bit discolored from it and I had to leave over it (totally... Sanitary?)

Most of this filling in had to do with a number of disturbing things. From me seeing people in the shadows (not monsters like, living breathing people that radiated malicious intent), I wouldn't sleep, I constantly cried, I started peeing my pants, and a couple more things I think were genuine hallucinations. I even slept walked into my parent's bedroom and asked my mom if killing her would break her love for me (my parents aren't liars by the way, and they never told this story with a light heart).

However, I remember one thing. A church, and I remember one person there: P.

P was my brother's best friend at the time. He had a history of coming on to random people but never anything too serious. He would always come around with my brother, my parents filled in a couple gaps including one where I spoiled a movie for him on accident.

P was in this church, and I was in the kitchen. I walked around the table, I saw him, and then my memory cut to a bouncy castle outside, but I can't remember anyone else. He was wearing a red shirt and khaki shorts, it was summer, and I had gone in with a crocodile ZooPals plate to get some grapes while everyone else was still outside.

About the time my memory stopped being a worthless POS, he stopped coming around. I later figured out that he tried to come onto my brother, and when my brother declined he started attacking him.

I tried to force myself to remember something about the church, but when I tried to remember past walking up to him in the kitchen, the details got extremely weird, like it was a mixture between what actually happened and a placeholder, like when you write over a deleted image and the recovered image is messed up to an extreme degree. This cause a panic attack the likes of which I hadn't felt before, and I tried to kill myself over it (obviously failed, thank god).

I'm not saying I have PTSD, nor am I asking if I do, it just sounds a lot like PTSD and I didn't know where else to post this. Its been weighing extremely heavy on me and I just needed to get it out.";0
1016;1016;1614_ptsd;"NSFW no one has to read this i just really feel like venting Trigger warning: sexual assault

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an absolute mess of a human and trying really hard to be okay, but a bit over a week ago I was watching a TV show with a boy I'm seeing where a girl was being raped and the rapist whispers 'shhhh' over and over. I tried to block my ears and i had my eyes closed, but the scene sprung up out of nowhere so i saw about 2 seconds of it.   


Ever since then I've been a mess. I've barely been able to shower, haven't been able to clean, haven't been able to eat, I didn't sleep properly for a few days (kept waking up every half hour). A couple of nights ago half way through sex I had a flashback and I don't remember anything after that, but apparently I was crying a lot and completely non verbal for a while. I 'completely shut down' and he had to really try to get any words out of me, apparently. the next morning i had false awakenings where i was just lying in bed being spooned, then his hand comes and grabs my mouth and shoves me into the bed. i woke up in a panic and realised he was just cuddling me so i must be dreaming, but other than that i absolutely can't distinguish what i dreamt from reality. I realise i've had the same thing before - dreams where 'arms', sometimes someones, sometimes invisible arms, grab my mouth and shove me into the bed.   


I have PTSD but I don't actually know what the cause is. I can make a very good guess, but I just have symptoms and learning my triggers, with no actual solid memories. apparently once I told a friend what i thought happened while i was throwing up and crying and screaming (first ever flashback episode), but i don't have any memory of even doing that.   


There was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't. He says it never happened. Now with this false awakening, I'm worried that I've thought ill of him when it actually was just all in my head. What if it was just a false awakening.   


I haven't been able to stop crying. i have this constant feeling of terror. And i have no one around me to help. because of my ptsd i push everyone away one way or another. when something triggers me like this i can end up completely non functional. i just want a normal fucking life and a normal brain and a boyfriend. i feel like i'm never going to be able to have any of that because of what some fucking cunt decided to do to a little kid.";1
810;810;2480_ptsd;"NSFW: Diagnosed with PTSD. Root trauma from five years ago. I had a group of friends since 2004, and remained friends with them up until 2014 when I finally cut communications with them. They were a very toxic group of racist, sexist, and narcissistic people. The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. 

1. The ""leader"" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like ""You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?"". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending ""laugh"" like ""Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha."" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.
2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.
3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.
4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like ""go kill yourself no one loves you""
5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.
6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life. He was the only one I kept in more recent contact, but I noticed some of his personality traits were very similar to the group.  He would do the same mocking laugh the leader did, the same type of criticism that the leader's favorite and the white supremecist did. And at a recent party, I found out he was trying to hit on girlfriends of my friends, and made a lot of people uncomfortable. After realizing all this, I realized he is just as bad as that old group and I cut him off.

Over 5 years have passed since then, and I still think about this. I feel like I wasted so much of my potential and energy during college and feel this is part of why I'm struggling so much in the present. I think hanging out with the ""best friend"" in recent years triggered it even more, and I've been stuck in a rut for nearly a year since then.

I don't know how to find peace with this.";1
40;40;53_ptsd;"OCD Hi All,

Have any of you developed OCD to a degree within your PTSD? Is this common? For example I have a lot of trouble sleeping beyond the nightmares, if I hear any noises outside or see a shadow or even my reflection in my bedroom window I am triggered. The last month or so I have started locking and unlocking my apartment doors, 10,20...30 times a night when I am triggered at night. This past week I have been doing it even when I am not triggered, for example when I return from work I will lock the door and then unlock and lock it a dozen times. My therapist suggested giving myself a limit of how many times I can do this and resist the temptation to continue by distracting myself. 
Any tips for this? Between nightmares and triggers my sleep is already disturbed enough, but spending an hour on the doors is really exhausting.

Thank you all!";0
655;655;2229_ptsd;"OD PTSD Sorry long story of overdose ..  I need some advice about something I exeprienced in which I cant really find anything similar to my personal account of seeing someone overdose elswhere online to try and get some answers, other perspectives...
although im still on the younger side, i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse just everything in which i am grateful for because it has made me very tough and able to relate with others.. i was dead sure i could handle anything but this . this has turned my world upside downn. it happened last july and i am much better mentally now but i still struggle with ptsd and triggers... i met this kid wonderful heart but misguided (not an addict)  and still has that feeling of invincibility..anyways we were in my room and the first incident we were on my bed and he was holding himself up on top of me kissing me and then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless . ill admit my first reaction was wrong, i was scared, and didnt realize his breathing and heart were stopping i was just shaking him yelling his name.. luckily he popped up and was like what happened wherr am i.. but quickly fell back into his high .. i knew from there something wasnt right so i was on high alert  (he had apparently taken stuff before he got to my house that i was guessing but wasnt sure).. after that he  snorted one in front of me i begged him to stop but he wouldnt and i couldnt force him to stop in that mindset he had . he then went in to use my bathroom (separate toilet room from shower area) and i was like okay ill just keep calling his name to make sure hes okay.. ( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right¿ but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone ""stops breathing"" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn ..";1

1105;1105;2319_ptsd;"Olfactory hallucinations Hey, everyone. I decided to come here instead of posting to advice because I think that maybe this would be the more fitting subreddit, but I'm not sure. Maybe one of yall can help me.

A couple of weeks ago, I was laying in bed and I started to smell something from my childhood - a gross mix of two different scents that I had only ever smelled in one place. It came in out of the blue and I had never had this happen to me before and I have no explanation for it. 

I looked everywhere for the possible cause, did everything to make it go away. I put vicks under my nose and that helped mask some of the smell, but it was still definitely there.

It didn't go away until the next day.

Has anyone else dealt with olfactory hallucinations? Should I seek out medical attention? Any advice and comments are appreciated, thanks.

992;992;1721_ptsd;"One heartbroken mom, here There are times we just cant stand the world we live in. Not on our own behalf, but in the suffering of others. I think some of us feel for people more than most, having survived our own worst nightmares. And it can take a toll on our personal wellbeing. 
My daughter went out to the bar with her friends Saturday. First time without mama there. But, her best friend's dad works in the kitchen. Big tough (but sweet) guy everyone knows and respects. Her other friend's dad was there watching out for her. She was with the two most responsible 21 year olds I know, her best friend &amp; her protective boyfriend, who I love like my own. She was less than a minute from our house! My nervous mommy-heart tried to rest assured, she was safe. And, she was.
But. A 20 year old kid, not a local, was here for labor day. He was staying in a summer cottage by the lake. There are 2 bars on my road. He, with the big holiday crowd, managed to slip into the bars, looking for a girl. He came up to the kids' table, chatted and asked if they'd seen her. He left on foot. Mag and her friends left the bar after 3. That kid was dead within the hour, found unresponsive on the road near the last bar. They had JUST talked to him!! It was initially believed he was the victim of a drunken driver, hit and run. But now, there are more questions. Cause of death is pending autopsy. The kids are devastated. My town is upside down. Her friend worked there that night in the kitchen &amp; joined them after. She worked last night as well, came here in tears, just heart torn. My babies are hurting and I can't bear it! And the world feels that much more dangerous. So difficult to ever feel the same. She was safe..
And..where one of my best friends lives, a 2 year old was hit by a car and killed. This on the tail of a 10 year old murdered, strangled by her stepmother, all this weekend in the same area.
I'm shook. Anxiety is BEYOND. All these young ppl lost in the space of days, it's stomping my heart. In times like these, dark dark days, how the hell do we have Faith in this sometimes ugly, evil world again?!😔💔";0
283;283;655_ptsd;"Online gore can destroy you. I brought this to myself. I might be the most stupid man I know.. I'm sorry, it'll be a long story.

The first thing I remember being related to this would be when I was 11. I ended up with a picture of an 18yo corpse, in midst of the most disgusting putrefaction. I'd never dared to imagine that was what was coming to me when I'll end up dead. Of course, you can imagine it traumatized me. I couldn't sleep for weeks, I was terrified of the dark and this picture haunted me, forced itself into my mind and I saw it literally everywhere.

It sounds stupid. I know. It gets worse.

I developed, what I understood way later, something called as necrophobia. I realized it when my mother died 2 years ago. I barely mourned her, or maybe I did but in a really quiet and subtle way I still do not understand. I couldn't show up to her burying. It was definitely impossible. I just said goodbye to her while she was getting medicated and ran off when they decided to euthanize her. I couldn't get to see her for the last time as something that terrifies me. I just couldn't. I can't describe it. There was no way.

Yet.. something did change. I changed.. a bit. I developed a close relationship to death. Not in a way that makes me want to join her. But a sense of morbidity and nihilism I did not know I had. 

It developed further as I wanted to confront myself. To make these flashes stop. Just like I did when I was terrified of bees. I decided to confront my fears, to watch death in front of my very eyes. To rationalize it. To be, let's say.. desensitized.

This was the poorest choice of my life. I ended up watching dozens and dozens of pictures, videos. I saw dead people. I saw dying people. Various ways. Horrendous ways. I really don't want to tell what I saw. I'm not made for this. I've never been made for this. Now I'm back to being 11. But 10x worse. I have regular flashbacks of these, each time I turn the lights off. Each time I see a violent clip in a movie or a strange music plays on. It's been months, and it stained me. It damaged me. I can't stop thinking about my mother now. What she endured. What she felt. My stomach tightens whenever it crosses my mind. I fear I might have developed PTSD.. or I maybe I dug an old one up. I feel totally lost. And it hurts so much. I feel like I brought this on myself. 


TLDR : I'm weak and stupid. Never watch these. It can destroy a man.";1

556;556;144_ptsd;"Panic attack while dreaming A couple years ago I was involved in an incident that left me with pretty bad ptsd &amp; occasional panic attacks (that were mainly in the months following the incident when something reminded me of it. I still occasionally get panic attacks and sometimes they aren’t related to the incident, the last major panic attack I had was probably very recent after the incident.  I was too prideful to admit I needed help/ therapy and lately my anxiety has been getting bad, not even relating to the accident but school, etc. 


Yesterday there was an incident in my college town that resulted in a student death. I didn’t know the student, but several of my friends did from either back home or here at school so I was pretty upset to hear the news. 

Later that night I had a dream that I was at the scene of the incident and although they weren’t really similar incidents, I think it subconsciously reminded me of my incident and I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever had, all while dreaming. It was so vivid. I think I knew I was dreaming but I still could not calm down. I woke up later, not immediately after that and was soaked in sweat. 

It was different than the usual nightmare/ being scared etc. It was like I was reliving my past trauma again for the first time. 

TL; DR - Had a dream of an event that reminded me of past trauma that I never received help for &amp; relived a similar experience leading to a massive panic attack all while dreaming but it felt the exact same as if I was awake.

I noticed that when I was walking on the sidewalk today that I had all this mental dialogue going on (almost like schizophrenia) hearing all the imagined voices of the people driving past me making fun of me and laughing at me. Laughing at what I wore, laughing at my face, laughing at my walk. I was afraid that one of them would be someone I knew or worse, one of the people who bullied me.

*It is that because I was bullied by so many people (like 15) (ostracized, yelled at, made fun of and told constantly that no one liked me) that it must have been my fault, or else why would so many people mistreat me and even the ones that didnt partake just allow the abuse to happen and even become friends with these people? If they were really doing something wrong surely no one would willingly befriend bullies or not stand up to them when it happened everyday right? Because everyone knew it was going on, they all saw. It must be my fault of this allowed to happen. So I thought that since I caused it, there is something about me that will cause this to happen with other people aswell. Thus i see everyone as a potential bully, and no self talk changed the anxiety when I was out today***

I saw someone I knew and though she smiled at me I shut down and after our conversation I just wanted to go home and I wasn’t even present the entire time, my mind kept going back to memories of being yelled at and made fun of the whole conversation even though she was laughing with me. I kept going numb because I felt like if I emotionally checked out, then any bullying that I expected on her part wouldn’t affect me because I wasn’t emotionally there in the first place. All of which I became aware of is something that always happens but cbd made me more conscious of it, it made me more conscious of things that had already been there but I just ignored/I had been denying because I didn’t want to accept that I was mentally ill. 

So how do I, I guess stop thinking that I was at fault for being bullied, or even if I WAS doing something wrong that they just exaggerated my flaws and that I am not a monster that will just be rejected and made fun of by everyone across the board?";1
236;236;307_ptsd;"Parents aren't understanding I was diagnosed with ptsd after an incident that happened about a month ago. I've moved back interstate with parents because I felt safer and because I sustained physical injuries, but some days have been so hard. 

They don't understand how ptsd is affecting me (even rejecting what I say when I try to explain, retorting that I'm exaggerating) and they have been pushing me to do things I am not comfortable with doing just yet. Examples: 1) Asking me to move back interstate by myself because that was my place of employment and they are worried about my job security, even though that was where the incident happened. 2) Leaving me to walk by myself rather than escorting me for an appointment because they judged the situation to be safe and that I should be ready to do this by now. 

Already explained to them that psychologist had said I had been pushing myself when I wasn't ready and I need to stop doing that. That was a week ago. Apparently they've forgotten all about that. Tired of explaining to deaf ears. What can I do?";1
319;319;1224_ptsd;"Parents Divorce Well, i don’t exactly know if i experienced the most extremely traumatizing event compared to witnessing a death and being raped, but because of the fact this is an open community and we care for each other i thought i might get some support.

When i was nine... my mom decided to divorce from my dad... in most cases it wouldn’t be too bad... in this case it was different... this entire shit storm caused my diagnosed PTSD. I faced my dad getting destroyed by my mom in every way possible... from my dad having to sleep in his car to my mom who aways said my dad was a demon... from the most horrible things you could imagine... my mom wrote a letter to her lawyer stating that my dad “beat us” “Physically abused us” and “mentally abused us” my mom is delusional, She has mental health issues...  Because of this she only sees her own reality instead of the actual reality... now skipping ahead... when i was 12 my mom kicked me out of her house because her new boyfriend who moved in with us almost immediately hated kids... He played her in such a way that my mom started hating us. A couple of weeks later when i moved in with my dad.. My sister still lived at my mom’s. my sister had enough of being isolated from the people and family she had been with her entire life.. so she said “mom i wan’t to go to dad to see my brothers...” my mom took this as a sign of her wanted to move into with my dad’s as well... when they dropped her off there was a giant hassle between my dad and my mom’s boyfriend... her boyfriend pulled out a pickaxe (i know right what the fuck) and threatened my dad. I proceed to calling the police and they show up... we got Youth counseling at the end but that didn’t work as planned... they damage had been dealt and still to this day me and my mom are rivals.. she’s a delusional alcoholic who lost her mind. I’m currently in therapy to get trough this mess... i still see the frames of the fights, abuse, and suffering i had to deal with, with such a young age... anyway... thanks if you made it this far... you guys are awesome❤️";0

66;66;24_ptsd;"Partner Committed Himself to a Psychiatric Hold and I'm Trying Very Hard 
My SO has been really distant with everyone he knows lately and it began to worry me and everyone else. I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his ""voice"". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend ""Jay's"" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.

The next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with ""Jay"". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.

Back when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. 



I knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. 


Earlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a ""shooting in the woods"" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. 

And then this happened.

I'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.

I don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know.";1
960;960;2055_ptsd;"People have such burning hatred for poor people, and it's extremely..... upsetting I suffer from PTSD from mutiple different things in my life, but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when I was homeless for a year. 

In America at least (though Im sure in other places as well), once you become homeless or in poverty, you're no longer a part of ""society"". You're not a ""member of society"", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money. The moment you become """"worthless"""". 

Here's a conclusion i guess,,, Anyone else traumatized by poverty/homelessness, or more specifically, how people treated you because you were in poverty/homeless";0
6;6;106_ptsd;"Phobias - Dolls, Mirrors, Roaches TW: child sexual abuse

It’s only been a year and a half since I discovered I had repressed my father’s sexual abuse.  I pretty much blanked on much of my early life before going to school; my elementary years were marked by extreme fear and neuroticism; from junior high on I was numb and depressed.  Understanding my father now as a pedophile, narcissist, and abuser has been the missing key to explaining so much about my life.  Now I’m trying to recondition my behavior to be adaptive instead of maladaptive, which means piecing together the origins of my fears and anxieties. 

As a child, I hated dolls and sought the comfort of stuffed animals instead.  As an adult with overt PTSD, I notice I have a heavy preference for non-human animal company.  I struggle with some misanthropy.  Was my doll phobia related to the sexual abuse? Did I see myself as a doll in some way? I was super triggered by the movie The Exorcist, and as an adult, I see so many commonalities with child sexual abuse. 

I also had a phobia of mirrors.  Whenever I would brush my teeth, I was terrified that when I looked down to spit and looked back up, my face would be different, or someone would be behind me.  As an adult, I realize I never had a stable sense of self.  My existence was always conditional (on appeasing my abuser).  And I wasn’t allowed to have my own will, not when it conflicted with his.  As I’ve become more comfortable with myself, mirrors scare me less.  This one makes sense to me. 

The cockroach one can probably be explained by some traumatic instances with roaches.  I remember being at Fuddruckers, there being a cockroach on the wall and me being concerned but my family ignoring me, and later the cockroach being in my burger.  Things get foggy after that. . .  I don’t remember if I took a bite of the burger.  Another possibility is that my father abused me in a roach-infested place, like the office building he forced us to work in.  I remember having to spend nights there and being terrified of the giant flying roaches.";1

598;598;965_ptsd;"Physical symptoms getting out of hand Apologies if I'm not coherent; I'm really worked up right now. So, I was diagnosed with C-PTSD this past December as well as AvPD. I had already been in a long term battle with depression and anxiety, so I wasn't too surprised to have this thrown into the mix. A little backstory on me: I came from an abusive household and was put in foster care at 12, but aged out of the system as an unwanted kid. I've been abused in almost every way you can imagine by parents, foster parents, siblings, significant others, and peers.

My biggest issue right now is my physical symptoms. I thought I was handling everything well, but it's been brought to my attention that I'm not. I'm 24 and the longest I've held a job is 7 months. I work hard, but the stress of the job always eats away at me... physically. I get sick. VERY SICK. It all starts with headaches, then my body gets heavy, I catch fever and cough, headaches become migraines, then I'm throwing up and unable to move. It lasts for weeks, sonetimes months. My brain will be foggy. I'll forget what I'm saying as I say it. I forget important things. I forget to eat.

Even as I write this now, I'm sick. I've been ""sick"" for over a month. I've never noticed the pattern before and now I'm feeling hopeless about the rest of my life. I'm in fine shape physically... But i don't understand how my anxiety and stress can have so much control over my health like it is.

Does this happen to anyone else?? ";0
651;651;244_ptsd;Physical symptoms? I got a tentative diagnosis of PTSD at the end of last year by my therapist, and have been going to therapy on and off for a while now. I have nightmares sometimes, and panic attacks pretty often, but I also started passing out and ‘losing time’ and I’m not sure if it’s related to PTSD or if it’s a different thing, so I’m wondering if anyone here has had any related symptoms. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post it, but honestly you guys seem like a good community (this is more or less a throwaway, but I’ve been lurking for a while on another account). And I know that it says no medical advice, and I don’t know if this would really fall into it- I’m seeing a doctor regularly, and I don’t want advice about what to do more than just wanting to know if this is something other people experience. Anyways, when I black out it doesn’t feel at all like a panic attack, my vision goes dark while when I have a panic attack my vision goes bright and everything looks white. Also, during panic attacks I feel over sensitive/ every sense seems alarmingly heightened, but when I pass out it just feels like I completely lose control, everything goes black and I can feel myself falling and then I wake up. Ive checked with my doctor to see if it could be caused by heart problems as they run in the family, but all results came back completely normal. Honestly I didn’t even think of it being related to PTSD until a friend suggested it. Along with passing out, there has also been days where I look at the time and realize that somehow four or five hours passed by without me recalling any of it. I don’t use any substances, and honestly it’s a fairly scary experience and I don’t know if any of you have felt anything like that that ended up being related to PTSD. Thanks in advance! Sorry that this is kind of a messy post. ;0
714;714;2114_ptsd;"Please help me figure out what's happening/Vent (TW - Suicide attempt mention, panic attack). I've been dealing with depression and generalized anxiety for over three years, so my life has been colourfully scattered with panic attacks and random depressive episodes. I worked really hard to ignore them and wait to seek treatment until I was an adult, as I was afraid that I was faking my symptoms and didn't have a problem because it was just ""teenager hormones"". I also have never been great at taking care of myself. When I entered college this year I was walking in, completely in denial about my issues and unprepared to take care of myself. 


It took me only a week to have a melt down lmao. I had the worst panic attack of my life, I couldn't see and couldn't move and thought I was having a seizure. I quickly figured out that this wasn't working and sought a doctor who I later realized was not-great for treatment, who prescribed me Zoloft and Zopiclone, sleeping pills that I had previously had an addiction problem with. The Wednesday of my second week I immediately attempted suicide, had breakdowns every time I was left alone, downed pills like it was candy and was thankfully admitted to the hospital on Friday. There were so many fucking awful things I went through that week and I was out of control, and the suicide attempt scared the shit out of me. My therapist later told me the doctors theorized that my history of depression + my bad reaction to the Zoloft had led to my situation. I spent a week in a child psychiatric unit and dropped out of my college. There's so many other things I could talk about but this post is already long enough and that's not what this post is about.


I'm terrified of what happened to me. I'm in a really great environment right now— I have an amazing support system, am able to stay in a lovely home with understanding parents who want the best for me. It's been almost two months now since the whole ordeal and I'm in recovery from my depression, seeing therapists and have a new doctor. I feel better. But I can't shake the experience and it keeps popping up.


The college I was at has offered me guaranteed admission into the winter semester, but I can't go back. When I returned to the college a couple days after I left the hospital I was fine, but I couldn't enter the bathroom I had a panic attack in. I was also roommates with a lifelong best friend of mine during this whole ordeal who I am no longer friends with because of how she dealt with everything. I can't stand the thought of going back to the college, the one I walked around in a drug-fuelled stupor and the one that contains an ex-childhood friend who dealt with my episode in the worst possible way. I'm also intensely afraid of going back to the way I used to be. I've never been one that's been afraid of the future, like going to college— these things have always excited me. But now things like school, work, living with roommates/independently; they scare the shit out of me. I have hazy memories of suffering from depression at night whilst pushing myself through shifts at work in the day or at school and I don't want to go through that again. I'm afraid to live with others and cause them problems again with my issues. Maybe I'm just being lazy, but the idea of going back to things like that stresses me out and has caused panic attacks. At the moment I am slated to get a job in the next week so I can work until January, then live with a friend in the city until summer, but the more I move closer to it the more I want to stay home until the next fall semester. I'm just scared of taking on responsibilities and putting myself through stress again, and letting others down. 


I was actually supposed to move in with a friend right away and went to live at her apartment for a trial week, and I wanted to leave after about three days and go home. I also slept in her bunk bed last Thursday night and woke up in the middle of the night, and thought for a moment I was back in my old college dorm (I slept in a bunk bed there too), remembered everything I went through and had a panic attack. 


Other mini-things like listening to old music I listened to, feeling anxiety/stress, having people ask me if I'm okay, deadlines etc. all are very likely to make me cry or get really pissed off and afraid. I constantly feel guilty asking things from anyone and I'm so vulnerable to stress that even the tiniest little things get me on edge and cause extreme reactions. I'm also having a big problem with memory since it is one of the side-effects of abusing Zopiclone; so much so that I barely remember my life before now and if I do I am not emotionally connected to them (I feel like a completely different person now, so doing stuff the ""old me"" does also makes me panic). 


Sorry this is so long, I suppose this was sort of a vent as well, but I'm just really scared. I don't know if it's just a natural reaction to this sort of experience, it's PTSD, or it's just me being lazy? I'm saving this post so I can talk to my therapist about it but I just wanted the opinions of others. Is it possible to get PTSD from a suicide attempt/my experiences? Or does this just sound like a natural reaction, and if so— how long does this last?


The more things move the more I want them to slow down, and everyone in my life is trying their best to accommodate me so I feel bad asking them to do it even more. If I need to push through and do it, I want to try my best; but I don't want to push myself too hard and risk anything like this happening again. ";0
683;683;2457_ptsd;"Please help me understand Hi everyone,

I’m having some difficulty understanding what’s going on in my head at the moment. I think I may have PTSD, at least, I appear to meet the DSM 5 criteria for it. The thing is that even the thought of PTSD had never popped into my head before a couple nights ago.

I was watching a cop drama where the main character had to go to a therapist for an evaluation. All of a sudden, BAM, that sounds a lot like me.

So here’s my story.

Last year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed. I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can’t and even if I could I probably wouldn’t share). Unfortunately, she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn’t save her. I had to relay all this whilst it was happening to my dad and my brother who were back in our home country. 

They were able to come out the next day luckily but I was alone all night.

Ever since then I’ve thought that I was just grieving normally for my mother. I do go to a therapist about it once a week. Whenever I talk to people about what happened they always say “it must have been so traumatic” but I myself have never used that word to describe it, not even in my own thoughts.

Now though, I can’t stop thinking that this may actually be affecting me. Actually, I knew how badly I was being affected but I just thought that it was part of the grieving process. I called a friend tonight and told her what I was thinking and she told me that she’s suspected it for months! She didn’t know how to tell me what she thought. I’m not mad or upset at her or anything but I am a bit shocked that someone could come to that conclusion so long before I even thought about it! 

I’m not self diagnosing but I would like to know for certain if it is PTSD or not. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and am planning to ask her.

Did any of you have this BAM realisation? How did you go about things afterwards?

Thank you for reading";1

When I freak out, I can get mad and impulsive, or cry and want to hide in the smallest, darkest spot possible. I hate people seeing me react though, so if I get triggered in public, I’ll just hold it in so no one can tell. Which actually feels way worse than just letting it out.

1001;1001;1584_ptsd;"Positive Post Hi! I got diagnosed with PTSD the 30th of January. So I'm new to it and the subbreddit. I have it because of repeated childhood trauma and 2 weeks ago, my therapist gave me a few leaflets about anxiety and PTSD. One of the leaflets said that people who experience trauma as a child usually have an underdeveloped hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

Reading that scared the living hell out of me. I thought there was no way I could improve with a damaged brain. But today I learned that is just not the case. The brain is moldable. The brain is trainable. I don't know if I can gain back the actual brain mass? But regardless, I have been assured by my doctor that it won't impact my ability to recover. The brain can learn to use the hippocampus/prefrontal cortex differently and that's what matters. 

So if anyone else happens to be worried about this. Don't worry. Everyone can heal.";1
328;328;1225_ptsd;"Possible trauma from hospitalization, and people think I need to get over it. I was 21 at the time, now I'm 22. In May of 2017, I got really sick out of no where. In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. 

At 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. 

The doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said ""what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?"" I said I didn't know what was wrong. 

After they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. 

They discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a ""nasty fever"" and told me to rest for a few days.

At 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. 

Positive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.

Being septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. 

I returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). 

Now I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. 

I constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. 

Thank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest. ";1
295;295;143_ptsd;"Possibly will be getting a diagnosis of PTSD soon, this is my story (TW) Hi I’m Hanna I’m 17, i grew up in a extremely toxic environment before my parents got divorced at the age of 13.
My parents would constantly scream at each other even sometimes breaking glass and when i was younger like 9 or 10 I thought it was completely normal, I remember going to friends houses and being confused why there house was so incredibly quiet. I remember vaguely one time when i raised my hand in elementary school and was like “my daddy cusses alot” or something like that and i thought it was funny as i was only in 2nd grade or something. I feel like I completely blocked out my childhood which my therapist said is a sign of ptsd along with other symptoms i will describe later. As i was saying i blocked out alot of my childhood, i remember when i first started going to therapy when i was 13ish they would ask why i thought my childhood was toxic and what happened and I couldn’t ever describe it in detail, this has happened multiple times between switching psychs and therapists and what i think is one of the main reasons a possible diagnosis was delayed for so long. I also have gotten panic attacks since around the same age (13) and currently have a diagnosis of panic disorder which i think will eventually be changed to ptsd. One of the main things that have effected me due to this was my horrible fear of any type of confrontation no matter how big or small even if it doesn’t involve me, like for example say two people i know get into a small fight and you can feel the tension that could possibly cause me to cry or even have a panic attack. Or if it’s a example that directly effects me like someone raising their voice at me, i will always cry without a doubt which has completely disrupted me having a job. This has also caused me to not be able to defend myself at all and i tend to get walked over ALOT and causes me to get in tons of toxic relationships amongst friendships and relationships. I was also sexually assaulted at 16 by a crush at the time and I don’t feel comfortable going into detail with this part but with the toxic childhood I completely blocked it out so I don’t get flashbacks with that trauma. But i know for sure i get flashbacks from the sexual assault I experienced as well as my mom often shaming me for the clothes i wear. I scream in sleep (night terrors) often as well and i know that can be related but i don’t remember the night terrors but often wake up dissociated for a few minutes after having one.

491;491;560_ptsd;"Probably destroyed a close friendship (TW: hurtful therapy experiences, sexual abuse, suicide) Long text, I'm sorry for that :/ I didn't know where else to talk about this. I think I was an asshole but I didn't know what else to do. Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker. 

So, I have/had a friend that was very supportive and understanding and really helpful in the past. I absolutely honor what he did for me. 
But a while ago, he was less and less understanding, to a point where I felt he defended my abusers by making excuses for them. For context, for a few years I was kept in hospitals that did a lot of harmful and highly unethical ""treatment"" and I couldn't get out of it, I had no chance to get out of there. When that started, I was already slightly traumatized by events before, and the longer I was kept in hospital, the more suicidal I got. It was absolute horror for me and ever since I am terrified by doctors. 
He told me things like ""they surely had their reasons for that"" or ""oh, people simply make mistakes"". Especially the ""they had reasons for that"" really really hurt me. 

I then decided to talk to him an tell him, that it hurts when he does that, and ask him if he either could stop talking like that or that we might not talk about this topic at all. He apologized that he made me feel that way, but that we just have different opinions on parts of this. Now, this is the point where I probably got unfair. His girlfriend was sexually abused, and I am really really sorry that has happened to her.  What I shouldn't have done, but did, was asking him directly if he would tell her, that the guy surely had his reasons for that or just made a mistake. I know he is very emotionally involved and takes her pain as well and hates that asshole. It was unfair to compare it and remind him of that pain and hate. My trauma isn't that obvious, and I absolutely don't want to compare it. Whatever reason caused it, is valid, and the outcome is equally bad. Absolutely no discussion on this. But I felt like he didn't take me that serious because they were medical professionals who just made some mistakes. I apologized for what I said to him, but got no more answers. Think I fucked it up completely and hate myself for that.

So to start off, I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, but I do suffer from trauma and I didn't know a better place to ask for help.

My story is rather personal, but in a nutshell: I have suffered and still suffer from verbal and also, probably, emotional abuse from a family member. Screaming, cursing, and other awful things have been said over the course of many years (I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said over the course of my entire life).
All this left me traumatised, a major depressive disorder and also anxiety, which is luckily in remission. But I still suffer from images of specific events and also from stress. I can't live a day without thinking of the event and experiencing at least some stress. Now I know it's nothing extraordinary, but it does really haunt me. 

Now I'm asking for advice, but that's where matters become more complicated. I still live with said family member and that will likely remain the case for at least a few years.
So I am asking for advice on how to deal with past traumatic experiences and also for advice on how to deal with the present. 
I did sign up for EMDR therapy but I have to wait 4 months at least...

So do any of you have any tips or coping mechanisms for me to use??
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

I've been having flashbacks and panic attacks and started to feel suicidal because I can't seem to get my mind off of the pain.

I scheduled my first self defense class. The instructor is experienced with clients who have PTSD so I am hopeful. As I'm not in great shape currently he said he could start the sessions slower and invited me to some group sessions for when I feel more comfortable. I still feel embarrassed and intimidated but I think something good can come from this.

162;162;1112_ptsd;"PTSD and digitizing childhood vhs tapes Hi, I need to talk about this because I don't have anyone I'm comfortable sharing with.

I am going to bring up a couple things that I'm struggling with and share some background so this makes sense. I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.

I realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.

**Background**

Growing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she ""made it to where I didn't have to testify"". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.

I had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by ""quickly and physically ending the disagreement"". After hearing that I got out of his car, said ""goodbye"" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for ""leaving"" them.

**The Videos**

I started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought ""Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first."" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled ""1996"" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying ""no"" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?

I was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from ""1996"" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks ""right?"" to my sister and she says something like ""only mom and dad think \_\_\_\_\_\_ is a brat."" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.

I gave myself a couple days after that footage. I was afraid I'd see something worse. I decided to watch my sisters birthday party in 1996. It was on another tape labeled ""1996"". My sister is turning 5 and we are at the local pool with some childhood friends and some family. I see my cousin and I see my childhood friend. I instantly remember inappropriate things happening with those boys. My cousin used to pretend we were ""married"" when we were around that age. He would make me go into a bathroom after our ""marriage"" and undress with him. He always locked the door. He is about 2 years older than I am. I remember feeling like it was wrong but that he was older so it must be ok. I don't remember much of what happened in the bathrooms when this stuff used to happen. I know for sure it happened in 2 places. I know I was crying at one of them and my sister was knocking on the door. It was a family vacation. He has a daughter now and she is about 5. I hate him.

My childhood friend I mentioned, he also made me take my clothes off because of what ""grown ups do when they get married"". This must have been at the same age as my cousin incident. I remember something weird he did once he made me lay on top of him, he said we had to touch nipples....then I remember his mother walked in on us. I felt instant embarrassment and guilt, but being so young, I didn't know exactly what was wrong. She never said anything or did anything. This friend is still in my life and also has a brand new daughter. They were at my wedding and so was that cousin. I feel sick thinking about this. How could his mother not have done anything!!?? I saw her face in that video too and felt even more sick. Once we were in the high school ages, we spent more time together. He talked me into cheating on my boyfriends because ""kissing isn't cheating"". He'd feel me up and I told myself it was ok because we weren't having sex. I hate myself for this.

I hate seeing these people on my video tapes and remembering these things. It makes me feel like my family isn't real. It makes me question if things really happened even though I know certain things definitely did. I continue to doubt myself and pretend I'm ok. I'm not ok. I'm having a very hard time with these new things and I feel physically sick reliving these things.

**Can having abusers in life be a pattern for some survivors?**

I have had far too many moments in my life where my innocence was taken from me or I was hurt in different ways. I was raped by an ex for years. He took photos of me after he drugged me when he took me out of the country. He was so much like my father. So many red flags and I should have ran screaming, but he was SO manipulative. He told me no one would ever love me like he loved me. He exposed me to HEP-C for years and never told me. He cheated on me. He would tell me I was overweight and that my style was boring. He told me I didn't ""do anything"". He would force me to have sex with him every day multiple times a day. I was fresh from treatment, he was sober and had been for years. I thought he was safe. He even convinced my mother he was great along with other family. He has thousands of nude photos of me from the age of 18-22. He refused to destroy them when I begged for many years. He'd always convince me to come back when I'd leave him or when he said something painfully horrible. He'd show up at my apartments while I was in college in the middle of the night yelling at me. He was a 3x felon. He was an addict and when I left for good, he started drinking again and then using drugs. No idea where he is now, but I pray it's prison. He had his 3 strikes.

I also have been in a friendship where a guy in college became obsessed with me and stalked me. I had to go to the Dean of Students because he had signed up to be in every one of my classes. This was after he had left things at my doorstep, stood outside my front door at 3am whispering my name and sending me paragraphs about how he wanted to ""practice having sex"" with me ""because we are best friends"" and he ""felt like I would give him feedback"" *WHAT THE FUCK!?* \- Guess what - the college only asked him to change classes. That's it. The Dean told me they would kick him out of the college, expel him from classes that semester or ask him to change his classes. I had to tell all my professors on my own because the college didn't have my back. He even showed up in NY when I moved after college, and I moved across the country.....I finally got rid of him when I moved from NY.

There was a guy in college who raped me because I was too drunk to drive home one night. He offered his bed and he slept on the couch until he joined me in bed later that night. I woke up and he was having sex with me. I remember he noticed I woke up and put a condom on. I was frozen. I didn't know what to do. I left when I could see the sun was coming up. I wouldn't talk to him and he acted like he didn't know what was wrong. He'd even send me texts if he was on the same bus to tell me he was behind me. I'm still confused by that.

I'm sorry I spilled this mess here. I have a lot in my head and I don't know how to get it out. I have no one to talk to. No one understands unless they've had these things happen. I'm tired of sharing with someone I feel I can share with and they tell me they don't believe me, or ghost me completely. I had began to keep it all to myself for a few years in college and now I'm busting at the seams with flashbacks and panic attacks. I had a flashback when I was skiing with my husband this year. My father did things to me once when he was teaching me to ski as a kid. I was in the trees and it all came back. I don't know how to talk to my husband about these things. He doesn't understand. He means well and he's good to me, but he will never understand what I feel and what happened to me. I've never been able to really heal from any of this and I'm just now remembering things. I feel like a pile of used, damaged crap. I'm in a new city now, and I don't have any close friends here. I feel lonely and these flashbacks have affected my social abilities. I'm always on edge and I just thought I could share on here and someone might be able to tell me I'm not crazy and that I'm not bad for what happened. I feel I am though.";1
343;343;273_ptsd;"Ptsd and humidity 
Last year I moved to a state in the USA  that gets very high humidity and heat during the summer and we are already experiencing humidity in January that is triggering my PTSD.

Humidity is a major trigger for me - I didn’t realize this until last year. It makes me feel suffocated, I have panic attacks or at the least various elements of a panic attack. I feel like I can’t breathe. Humidity has become a huge issue for me in being able to manage my PTSD as the suffocation and crushing feeling I feel replicates physical aspects of my trauma. I’m so concerned as we head into warmer months. 

I know I need to leave the area and that’s on my agenda, I just can’t do that before summer comes and goes. I am currently trying to come up with ways to manage my day to day life. Working from home, not venturing outside as much as possible. But even the ride from home to office is enough to send me into a spin for about an hour. At the worst of it last year I was afraid to leave my house because of the heat and humidity. So.... yes, I have to plan for all of this...but...

Any ideas, thoughts, similar experiences???? I am really worried about this. 

It may seem silly to be afraid of weather but the feeling of suffocation and what that reminds me of plus there is the addition of the climate I was in at the time.... and I think my body and mind just panics and I don’t know how to manage it while also trying to make my job not see me physically panic.

294;294;255_ptsd;"PTSD and Sex I don't know what messed up part of me makes me the way I am so I am seeking answers.  I was raised by a narcissistic physically and verbally abusive mother and sister.  An emotionally absent, verbally abusive father.  I suffered sexual abuse by I don't know who all.  I know it was older kids in the neighborhood, but I have long thought there was an adult involved as well.  I am an HSP and have severe OCD.

I read this forum, and the CPTSD forum, and it seems most avoid sex.  I avoid romantic sex, but the crazier and kinkier it is the more I want it.  If I am ""making love"" with my wife I can't stand it.  I feel weird, and usually cannot complete the session.  If it's a kink fest, the weirder the better, it's the best sex ever.

I have always been that way.  In my teen and early adult years I would have sex with anyone, any sex.  Made life difficult in the 80's in the deep south.  But I was known to make you feel friggin' amazing.

But it seems to all boil down to I have to be giving others pleasure.  My own is not even a consideration for me.  My pleasure is in debasing myself to whatever level to make whoever I am with have amazing sex.  My germaphobic OCD is probably the only reason I haven't had anything worse than chlamydia.  Kept me faithful to my wife as well probably.

Does anyone else have this issue?  I feel so freakin' weird.";1
155;155;164_ptsd;PTSD and the Police My parents are Mexican but moved to the US in the 80s. We used to take trips to Tijuana regularly because it was about 4 hrs away from our home. My first negative experience with figures of authority involved border agents sending us to secondary revision because my father didn't understand English very well and responded incorrectly to one of the questions. They asked if we brought anything from Mexico and he said no but because we had grocery bags in the back that was enough to cause suspicion. We were let go eventually but I still remember the dread of the event. Recently, I've had to deal with police officers coming to my residence looking for someone claiming to have an arrest warrant. The three times they were here I felt insulted, violated, subhuman. The police have insulted my disability. They've forced their way into my home while claiming to be willing to talk outside. They've threatened to break down doors. I've reached out to friends in activist circles and they've helped me deal with some of the trauma and given me information about organizations to reach out to. I've only been able to sleep sporadically. I'm afraid to open doors or go outside. I haven't been taking my meds. Everytime I feel like I'm making progress, something gets in the way of my recovery. It's not fair. I wish I had super powers so I could protect myself, my family, my community. I'm still that scared child in the back of my parent's car who's unable to stand up for herself or her parents. God, please help me.;0
81;81;1147_ptsd;PTSD Any advice for ptsd that rebounds after getting sober. I have done great with abstaining and as my brain continues to heal so do so many memories repressed. So many triggers and it keeps getting worse. I knew it was coming and I know I am going to continue to stay sober even if it means being in a troubled head space.  I feel like getting alcohol out of my life was critical to get better. Now I feel like I'm sober long enough to want some kind of life without jacking up my sobriety. And that means addressing my demons the worst is me. I am a functioning ptsd person as in I can hold a job only because without that nothing can get me out of my head.  Therapy and ssri drugs do not work the drug's make it worse for me and my doctor knows I never want anything addictive prescribed.

I relocated to another state 3 years ago to get treatment and I’ve been off of heroin since I left my home state.  I met my soon to be wife, had a baby and work a good job with benefits.  Everything was getting so much better.
But I left with active warrants in 3 counties and we took a flight back to one of those counties to start taking care of it.   
Pretty much the whole time we were there I was fine.  Saw the judge, explained why I left and let him know I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get this out of the way of my life.  
It went well, but I have two other counties to appear at in the near future.  Everything went better than expected. 
Since we came back home It’s like a switch was flipped and everything feels out of control.  I don’t feel safe anymore.  I don’t know what’s going to happen and I’m having a really hard time coping with the reality that I’ll probably be locked in a cage again at some point. I found myself curled up at the foot of my bed yesterday crying with my entire body convulsing as I remembered very specific events that have taken place over the last 10 years.  
I can’t sleep, I can’t handle my daughter when she cries, I keep flipping out in anger over the smallest triggers.  (Wife burned her hand on a hot plate, screamed in pain, and I flipped out.  Yelling at her and had to leave the house for a walk to cool down.). 
Anyway I’m wondering what I can do to stop myself from emotionally hurting the people I love during this time.  I’m not violent, never physically hurt anyone, but I’m so afraid of ruining the life I’ve built while I learn how to process all of this and move forward.  It’s so strange to me because right now I’m totally fine.  I can think of all the worst memories or possible outcomes and be totally willing to go through it, but my episodes have been triggered so quickly and randomly that I don’t see how I can stop myself in the moment.   
Is it normal to be able to recall memories and be fine with it one day, and then have a completely insane reaction throughout my entire body over the same thoughts another day?   
Again, I’m not worried that I’m going to do any physical damage to anybody, I just don’t want my family to see me like this and remember it for the rest of our lives together.  I don’t want to scare them or cause their own traumas and issues in life because of my inability to rationalize this.  
I have my first emdr session coming up on Thursday and I’m going back to work in the morning so I think that will help.   Mostly wondering if it’s normal to be fine one day and completely fucked the next, and what you guys have found that helps you with this.";1
522;522;631_ptsd;"PTSD court treatment update #2: The Euphoria is wearing off and reality is setting in. It’s not all bad, but it’s not all good. It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

1038;1038;1800_ptsd;"PTSD diagnosis So, I was looking into PTSD, due to things from my past, and came across C-PTSD. I was shocked at how much it made sense in my head. I’ve never discussed a PTSD diagnosis with a doctor or therapist as I really didn’t think I could have it. I always assumed the trauma had to be physical or something along the lines of being in a warzone, not something such as verbal and emotional abuse. I’m curious as to how I could bring this up to a therapist or a doctor without looking like I’m making my problems more than what they are. 

When you were diagnosed, if you were, did you bring it up yourself? Or was it suggested? If you brought it up yourself, how did you do it? Were there any kinds of resources you had to back yourself up? 

I’m not saying this is the be all, end all of my mental issues, it’s just something overall that has made the most sense that encompasses all the problems I seem to face. It would be something worth exploring, I think.

938;938;2672_ptsd;PTSD dreams So nearly every night for the last 5+ years my dreams have taken place in the house I grew up in. It’s the house where the trauma that gave me PTSD took place but it’s also the only home I knew until I left very suddenly in the middle of the night 13 years ago. I’ll even have normal dreams but they always take place there. I’m begging this house to release me but it’s obviously my brain’s way of processing the trauma of leaving my home and not getting any closure.;0
860;860;2196_ptsd;PTSD During Sex I’ve been sexually harassed and catcalled since I was at least 10. I’ve been in many situations and relationships where I was manipulated and emotionally abused into having sex, or I was even harassed by my own partner. I’ve been in many sexual situations where my own pleasure and desires didn’t matter. And ever since the relationship I was in before the one I have now I’ve had breakdowns during and after sex, I feel anxious, I feel objectified (even if my partner is not actively objectifying me), I feel sad, depressed, and scared. It worries me that this will always continue, I don’t know how to get past it and I don’t know how to cope with it. My girlfriend feels like shit every time I have a break down because she feels as though it’s her fault. It’s not. It’s not hers and it’s not mine. I’m just really scared this is always going to affect my sex life. Especially because I’m a very non “vanilla” person and some of the things I used to pursue during sex I’m starting to feel as though I cannot anymore, some of those things make me feel disgusting, or like a toy or an object, or like my only purpose is to be used for sex. I have no clue what to do. I can’t afford a therapist just yet and I was wondering if any of you lovely people could help me figure this out a little bit?;1
136;136;486_ptsd;"PTSD from a bad trip? so about two months ago I went on a family vacation and took a large amount of ecstasy. (first time doing a whole pill)


I went home and surprisingly I was able to sleep, everything was fine until I woke up in the middle of the night sweating like crazy, shivering and started to hallucinate. I saw robbers in the house, and they were all wearing some sort of mask, one that stood out was a guy eating a coven mask. I dead ass believed someone was in the house so I woke up my brother and he told me I was going insane and that there was no one there. 

fast forward to now, I can’t stand seeing people with masks, I get really uncomfortable around them, even a picture of someone wearing them makes me uneasy. 

I also feel mildly uncomfortable in my home alone, since I left before my family and stayed alone for 2 weeks after trip which was horrible ( I had extreme paranoia, didn’t sleep for 4 days because I was scared and kept seeing things) 

could this be Trauma? and if so what can I do to stop it?";1
869;869;1583_ptsd;"PTSD from boyfriend of 5 years almost dying... It’s kind of hard for me to find anyone to talk to besides my therapist about this, because I don’t know if it’s the same feelings as when someone goes through this and their loved one actually does pass. 

A brief summary of what happened: The day after Thanksgiving I ended up convincing my boyfriend to go to the urgent care for a pain in his side that he’d been feeling for a few weeks but had gotten to the point where he was having pain with every breath he took. We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn’t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He’s not able to workout because he’s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. 

I was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.

I feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn’t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he’s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It’s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...

Not to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing. It’s just so much to deal with all at once and I just feel so alone like no one else can understand what I’m going through.";1
519;519;519_ptsd;"Ptsd from death I just wanna start out by saying that I'm not formally diagnosed with ptsd so if I don't belong here I'm really sorry but I feel like the symptoms I'm experiencing are incredibly similar and I was wondering if anyone could help. I don't like going into details about this but when I was 15/16 my school friend went missing (we had a very small school, maybe 10 people per class? It was for ppl with mental health problems I had/have pretty severe depression and anxiety) it was just when we had finished secondary school so lots of us assumed she'd ran away from home. She hadn't and her body parts were later found and her step brother arrested for it.
After this I completely shut myself off from my friends, I didn't even talk to my therapist about it (I was with CAMHS) I didn't let myself be sad about it at all. Now that I'm 20 i feel like everything reminds me of it. I can't watch anything true crime/murder related without feeling weird and everything remind me of what happened. Even GoT has been a bit much with beheadings etc... And I know I could just avoid watching stuff like that completely but you'd be surprised how often murder comes up in basically any TV show. I can't deal with dissociating everytime I think about it and see something that makes me think about it. I don't know what to do, I'm already on medication for my depression /anxiety (100mg sertraline). I just feel like I can't talk to anyone about it because not only is it horrible for me people never know what to say.
Again sorry if this is the wrong place to put this, all in all I'm just asking if anyone has coping methods for certain triggers I guess?";1
1161;1161;2051_ptsd;PTSD from earthquakes I’ve been wanting to talk to someone about this.  Three days ago there were 2 earthquakes in California. The second one is the one that impacted me the most, I was pretty calm after it happened, but afterwards I started to search it up on my phone, and I came across the fault of San Andreas.  After reading more and more about it, I just started to get really paranoid. I thought that another earthquake was gonna happen and I was gonna die. I remember staying up all night, and I was convinced that I was gonna die. The whole night I was thinking of ways I was gonna die and was was gonna happen when I was dead. I’m making this post after the day a follow up earthquake was likely to happen but didn’t. But yesterday I was just so scared thinking about the earthquake that happened a day ago that when I wanted to do something, I was thinking in my head what’s the point?, I’m gonna die today anyways. I can’t relax in my bed anymore, if I don’t move for more than a few seconds I start to get paranoid and think that the bed is shaking from an earthquake, and I also think back to the day I thought I was gonna die. Honestly I don’t know what to do or if this is considered ptsd at all.;0
880;880;1524_ptsd;"PTSD from forced sex work A bit of background here - I (29 F) was heavily involved in the drug scene back in my early twenties. Prior to that, in high school, I was very promiscuous (possibly as a result of taking medication meant for depression while actually being bipolar, perhaps sending me into a mania).

In my drug phase, there were lots of times I’d have sex for drugs. Sometimes I wouldn’t expect it - thinking that I could just pay the guy for my drugs like a normal transaction, but they ended up not wanting the money and I’d give in. 

the climax of it all happened when I was desperately looking for a fix and this guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help. I got in the car (I know, stupid as hell) and he ended up getting me a handful of pills. I didn’t know what they were, but I downed all of them. I passed out and then when I woke up, we were hundreds of miles away from where we originally met and he proceeds to explain to me that I’m “going to be working for him now”. He was a pimp. 

I spent the next few weeks in that situation - he took my cell phone, kept me drugged up, woke me up at 8am everyday to start working until the late hours of night. He’d yell at me if I had any bruises from someone being too rough with me. 

I had tried to kill my self then, but it didn’t work and woke up to him screaming at me about it.

The only way I was able to contact anyone was when I had developed an infection in my arm from IV drug use and he finally (after days of this) agreed to take me to the ER. I called my family from there and thankfully he agreed to just drop me off at the airport where they would pick me up.

I’ve talked about this many times in counseling, but it’s always been like I was talking about the weather. No emotion behind it, just nonchalantly telling the story.  

It wasn’t until very recently that I thought about the whole situation and realized that I had been kidnapped. That yes, I was looking for drugs and that was bad, but I was kidnapped and taken captive and used.

Since this realization, I’ve been having flashbacks, especially during sex. And having sex is a whole different can of worms for me - lots of times, my body doesn’t “feel” anything. It’s like I’m still in prostitution mode, where I act like I’m enjoying it but really can’t wait for it to be over. The only way I can get off is by imagining my partner having sex with other people - it’s like I can’t allow myself and my own body to experience pleasure. Imagining things like that make me feel like a creep and it takes
something that’s supposed to be intimate and skews it into this fucked up thing.


Last night, I felt it came to a head. I was having sex with my boyfriend and just began having flashbacks of my time as a prostitute - seeing images of guys putting money on the table, disassociating from my body and I then felt this sensation of such anger that I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted to bit my boyfriend across the face, scratch him, grab his face hard. I feel so terrible about it. I started crying and then of course that ruined the moment and the poor guy had no idea what was going through my head.

He knows some of what I’ve been through, but there’s so much he doesn’t know and doesn’t want to know. I don’t blame him. 


I want to enjoy sex again. I’m seeing a therapist and am on medication for bipolar, but this shit just haunts me. I can’t tell if I actually enjoy sex or just default to prostitute mode where i make all the sounds and motions of enjoying something, like I’m acting and playing the part. 

Does anyone else have similar stories that they can offer advice about? I’m in such a low spot. I’ve been contemplating suicide for feeling like such a burden.

TL, DR: past trauma affecting relationships - help?";1
1195;1195;1857_ptsd;"PTSD from Martial Arts I'm not sure if I'm looking for suggestions, or for people who share my experience, or just sympathy or to vent but.

Without really going into it, TL;DR martial arts training was a large part of a system of abuse I suffered and is a very large trigger for me.  A few times I've tried to see if there might be any resources, or if someone else might have a similar experience because seeing some of the kids in some more intense classes.... I can tell they're suffering too. But I get frustrated and feel so alienated when I try to look this kind of thing up and all I can find is article upon article about vets with PTSD using martial arts in their recovery.  Or other people using yoga(tangentially related and also a trigger for me). 

I know I can't be that weird, or my experience can't be that unique, but this is all I can find. Even regular resources recommend yoga and martial arts as a helpful grounding hobby and i understand why but I just... can't. I can hardly manage any exercise at all due to this but to have those two specifically repeatedly suggested and praised and healing when it's the opposite for me. I don't know how to convey it. I don't really look anymore but I feel like because of this not only is it hard to integrate with ""normal"" people but also people with ""normal"" trauma like an accident, or some less weird form of abuse. I hate it. Does this make sense? If you read this thanks for reading. I'm not sure where I wanted to go with this.";0
508;508;807_ptsd;PTSD from severe child abuse. I'm M16, and I can't function properly after a series of traumatic events regarding my dad, such as him beating me with a gold club and trying to run me over with his car multiple times. My grades are ruined and even though I feasibly could not complete the work due to insomnia and constant flashbacks and hallucinations, as well as many, many court dates and therapy, the county still refuses to offer any remediation for my now ruined academic record. I have dreams of becoming a lawyer for the military in the JAG corps, but I'm afraid that I'll never even reach that point especially with how I've been increasingly suicidal over the past few weeks. I'm scared and don't know what to do.;1
780;780;1613_ptsd;"PTSD from traumatic relationship vent/input So... this is my first time posting here... Not sure where I’m going with this. I’ve had my fair share of rough relationships, sure, who hasn’t? But the last few years has been beyond bad. Like ending a 10 year relationship, losing a job I loved bc of my mental health, trying to move on with someone else and dealing with mental torture that led to a suicide attempt bad. I feel so stupid and pathetic even typing this. I mean people have been through so much worse. Yeah I was sexually abused as a child but that was forever ago and I was never physically abused in my relationships. But on top of depression, anxiety, and avoidant personality disorder, I’ve also just been diagnosed with PTSD stemming from the last couple years. Maybe this is considered complex-PTSD and should be posted there instead? Sorry. 

It felt dumb to me hearing that. I know it’s possible. I guess I’m just in denial. But then I think about it. We didn’t even have a long relationship. 9 months. That’s nothing. But the last 3 months he inflicted more damage than I’d known in 10 years. I haven’t seen or spoken to him since my suicide attempt in September 2018. I’ve sought help. I’m on meds again and in therapy. I’m better than I used to be. Then today I got a message from his gf. There’s a whole backstory to her but it’s honestly just too complicated to explain right now. As soon as I saw her name everything came back. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I was lightheaded and dizzy. My chest was tight. I started sweating and felt like I couldn’t breathe. Like I was about to pass out. (Panic attack, I know) I could see him again perfectly. In my face screaming. I could hear him. Feel his skin. Smell him. Everything. I was watching a movie with my kids (they’re 13 and 11) so I calmly got up and went outside and just completely broke down.

I mean come on, it’s been a year and half. I feel like I’m doing better and then this happens and it’s like being kicked in the teeth right back to square one.";1
523;523;821_ptsd;"PTSD from Witnessing Pet Cruelty TW animal cruelty, animal torture, animal death

I'm pretty new to the idea of me having PTSD, since I always thought of PTSD in the context of war/physical harm. However, in the past two years, I think I've pinpointed that my emotional issues stem from a specific incidence of trauma from when I was a kid, but I'm doubting if this memory was actually 'traumatic enough'. 

When I was around 7 years old, I had a pet parakeet. My older brother, around 14 at the time, offered me a quarter if he could have my her. In my mind, since we lived in the same house, he could have the bird but she would still be here in the house, so it didnt matter. I don't remember much of the events that happened after that moment, but I remember that he had had a friend over and they were joking around. Anyways, we had the kind of glass windows that shut closed. At some point, my brother put the bird in the windowsill and smashed the glass slider against her, basically killing her violently. 

I believe I suppressed this memory, or blocked out most of it, since I don't remember much of what happened afterwards. 

I'm making this post because I have told only one person in my life about this situation, and while she is incredibly supportive and helpful with my emotional issues, I still feel in the back of my mind that this /isn't/ PTSD, and my issues don't stem from this experience at all. 

For the entirety of my life, I have felt an extreme, often paranoid fear of people close to me hurting me physically or even killing me. I am currently seeing a wonderful guy, but I feel like I have PTSD glasses on and am searching obsessively for signs that he's a sociopath. This obsessive fear, of someone close to me turning out to be a sociopath/someone who will violently hurt me, has been a ever present theme in my life, and I am wondering if this worry is directly caused by the experience with the bird, or if it's coming from something else. Thanks for support everyone. &lt;3";1

299;299;765_ptsd;"PTSD led me to be involuntarily discharged from my job (But this job is far different from the others I had in the past: this job was a God-send, a haven for the weary and the burdened, however nothing good really lasts forever.) Long time reader but first time posting things.

I never took counseling until now. In the past I used to work at two nursing home facilities and three restaurants but none of those workplaces never appeal to me, or you know never led me to consider thinking of taking counseling which is what I meant. Until on December 7th, 2017, my first day of orientation I was hired for a job at a nursing home where the backdrop view is phenomenal, it was like a valley along the canal and behind the fenced canal was someone's houses that looked like treehouses. Then there was a black cat and her third batch of kittens. Her first two batch of kittens were eaten by coyotes. 

Yeah we have a lot of coyotes around here. While coyotes were roaming around the small town, the third batch of kittens were taken to an animal shelter by a homeless woman. And they were taken to a better place the day before Christmas so that way they won't be fated to die by coyotes like the previous batch. I feel like me and the cat have something in common. Maybe she has ptsd - I don't really know. 

I don't want to sound evangelical but I feel like God had given me a second chance after I quit from the past nursing home. Well enough about the past job where I used to work.

I got an interview from this job while I was at another hospital which shared the same company. I didn't like the hospital where I was because the interviewer didn't tell me on the phone that he was sick and he wasn't going to show up. That was a red flag. One minute later........a woman called me on the phone and said she is a dietary supervisor from another hospital that shared the same company. 

The next day I was there and was greeted by a young woman. She is the same age as my older sister. And everything went downhill from there when my childhood bully is working there as well. She doesn't even remember who I am. I remember who she is. I yelled at her and I got a warning then I couldn't keep my emotion in check because there this short woman in the kitchen with Napoleon complex who is so manipulative. I didn't want to report her at first because the administrator is always so busy and I was just being considerate but instead I got shafted because I made an emotional outburst and she reported me to him. I told him everything but that was the last strike unfortunately. 

Well anyway I got discharged yesterday and I'm just writing this so I could make a progress report and see how much improvement I made because hopefully, in ninety days I could probably return to the hospital if the job is still available. I don't know. I hope so. I really like the job. I really like drawing caricature of my dietary supervisor in funny scenarios. But I guess nothing will ever last forever.  

The CNAs and the LVNs are really cool and hardworking. The administrator is nice but he has to abide with the law so I don't really blame him for having to discharge me like that. My dietary supervisor hated to see me go but I guess it was her first time being forced into the situation where she had to dismiss someone from the job. ";0

I've been working hard in trying to get better (which I recognise isn't the most helpful phrase, I should be working to live with myself), so I've been running 3 times a week, trying to eat properly (I have a poor relationship with food and body image, so when stressed I just do **not** eat), getting up in the morning (I like the mornings), and I've been doing art therapy. I make sure I go outside at least once a day. I've tried 2 medications. These all *help* but fuck, I am EXHAUSTED. Even when I do take days to myself, I am exhausted. Can I say why?

Because by my most up to date count, I have had 64 episodes of panic attacks (including some fun flashbacks) over the past 7 weeks - and I only know that because that's when I started keeping a panic journal to figure out wtf is going on as I was having frequent panic attacks before then too.

I can honestly say that **none of this is true.** My SO and best friends are worried sick about me, same with my family. They don't think I'm failing, and the only thing I know they're all struggling with is that they don't know **how** to help, and damn it all I don't have that answer for them either. I **wish**, fucking WISH, I could give them something, ANYTHING, to work with, because ffs then **I'd** have something to work with too.

Because I'm apologising and thanking people for every basic thing they do, I'm convinced one fuck up and that's it, they'll hate me forever now.

Because despite my usually extremely useful grounding procedures, I'm still feeling the pain in my body and I still shake. I'm fed up of feeling that the people I love will suddenly turn hostile, and I'm also scared of them suddenly dying.

Because I'm fed up of all of the crazy thoughts in my head!!

&amp;#x200B;

Oh there's so much more I could put here and vent about but fuck do I feel guilty for how long this already is. I have a lot of **feelings**  okay lol. I've been referred further on to specialists, and I live with my best friend, so don't worry you kind hearted folk at Reddit. I just need a bit of TLC I think, and I'm too scared of human irl people to reach out right now, but they know, they're aware, and I am safe. I'm just bloody scared and fed up. And maybe also hungry, who knows lol.";0

I am having trouble convincing the team that deals with my mental health that my ptsd nightmares are affecting me so badly that I am very often wetting my bed and at many times more than once a night and I also wake up and I’m covered in vomit or actually in the process of being sick that’s how graphic, brutal and gruesome they are and I’m so stressed out and for the most part only get 1-2 1/2 hours of sleep if I sleep at all I’m so scared that these nightmares are beginning to creep into my waking life that when a driver tooted his horn, making my dog jump, to which he found great amusement I found myself thinking of one of my nightmare scenarios playing out on the driver and it really freaked me out I’m terrified I’m going to end up seriously hurting someone and I don’t know what more I can do 

I know there’s medication for these dreams and I did ask for it but they didn’t know what I was talking about so they cut me off there and then and changed the subject aaaaaaaarrrrrrfh

I can’t stop reliving events that happened even in the middle of the day when I am in class or at work, I have unwanted nightmares about it and I moved across the country to go to college just so I could avoid my hometown and everything that led up to me spending time in jail.

I am not able to relate to anyone much anymore, I am not social nor do I try to be, and I always have this feeling of nauseousness. I am feeling very alone right now because no one around me understands what I have been through and why it is affecting me so much. today it is affecting me really bad. just needed to share and get this off my chest. ;0
465;465;177_ptsd;"PTSD recovery experience? tl:dr, Anyone have any rituals to help a recovering person to maintain an active lifestyle?

So I got my PTSD after i got t-boned in a car accident. I thought I was going to be fine as I was recovering, but the stress from my family and past relationships seemed to make me develop ptsd. The first year i was just really disabled and lost interest in everything. the next two years i decided to get more mobile, but then i had anger attacks and anxiety attacks (even when i wasn't angry, something i had no idea could happen before that).

So this year I started getting therapy, something i SHOULD have done a long long time ago. Things have been going good so far. I keep improving and I have days where i actually feel positive.

The hardest part still, it just like... getting physically active in order to do daily thing. There are still days where I wake up and my body feels like shit (not like how when i had anxiety attacks, just a general kind of shit). And it's just impossible to get really active everyday or just ""some"" days. Anyone have any rituals to help a recovering person to maintain an active lifestyle?";0
856;856;1555_ptsd;PTSD resulting from car accident. Was wondering if anyone had any advice for this. I got into a really bad accident about 9 years ago, and after nearly causing another accident a few days later after swerving when I saw an oncoming car I gave up driving. For about 2 years I could hardly get into a car without panicing. However, 9 years later, I have no problem getting into a car however I cannot fathom driving. Bad drivers still give me scares, but thats normal I'm sure. Most of my anxiety now comes from lack of self-confidence in driving, and imagining things like people running stop signs (someone ran a stop sign and hit me going 50 over the speed limit) at intersections. The inability to drive has deeply impacted my life and I would really like to get over the overwhelming anxiety that has limited me, so any advice or suggestions are welcome. For what its worth, anxiety has impacted me greatly in other aspects of life but this specific problem is rooted in a tramautic event.;1

I wanted to share with you all my nephew who is walking across the country, meeting with people where he can bring the conversation to more people about PTSD. He is trying to share what has helped him, talk to people about getting help, and bring awareness. I just thought I would share. I am very proud of him.  Hopefully, he helps some people or gets them to get help.

591;591;1010_ptsd;ptsd- feeling like life’s a party and i’m the pinata I feel like it’s so hard to explain to others what I’m going through because of the numbness I go through on a daily basis. Having ptsd just kinda makes me feel like I’m locked in the trunk while my brain’s driving, if that makes sense. Lately my mind’s been so fuzzy I’ve had trouble getting out of bed and taking my medication. I stopped going to therapy and quit in the middle of EMDR and I am having the hardest time trying to get back on track. The more I freak out thinking about, the more my vision is clouded. I start to think “Why did I stop? Can I even go back to therapy? What if they don’t want to help me anymore? Why can’t I get it right? I have a husband, what’s going to happen to us if I can’t get better?” and then I think about the fact that my family has to see me this way, it makes me more depressed, I get back in bed, and the cycle repeat itself. ;1

This sucks.";1
959;959;2529_ptsd;"PTSD, or am I just over reacting? This might be triggering.

This is my first time posting here. I never really considered the possibility that I might have PTSD until very recently. I'm currently 31...when I was 19, I entered into my first real relationship. It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much. The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.

After, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be ""getting him excited"" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong... Basically, it was my fault. I lived with guilt, shame, and just overall disgust for a really long time. 

Ever since then, I have not been the same person. I lost trust in people....I can't enjoy sex....I'm afraid to date and fall in love....I'm afraid of men touching me.... I just avoid relationships and love all together. 

And that was just the first relationship. I don't even want to get into the second relationship, but he sexually violated me too. He purposely tampered with a condom to get me pregnant to keep me from transferring away to college. He thought that I'd decide to keep his baby and stay local with him. I aborted it and moved away of course. That was when I was maybe 22 or 23. That was the last relationship. I've been avoiding dating because I'm afraid of history repeating itself. I've been single ever since and honestly, I'm just lonely and depressed. I never spoke to a doctor about any of this. I don't know what I'd be diagnosed with but I'm afraid. 

Fast forward to now, there's a good person in my life who likes me. I think he's interested in me....I like him too but I'm still afraid. I don't know what to do or how to behave...I don't know what a good/healthy relationship is supposed to feel like. I'm just nervous all the time and its involuntary...I can't control how I feel. The new person said that I'm hard to read. Like, he doesn't know how I feel about physical touch... I'm sure he can tell that I'm nervous. I just don't want him to think that I'm not interested in him, or that I'm disgusted of him because that's not true. 

For a long time, I'd zone out...get lost in my thoughts. Oh, and nightmares. I'd have random nightmares of being attacked, violated, raped, assaulted, or just chased. Over the years I've been able to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, and that I shouldn't feel guilty or shameful. I tried practicing self love for a long time and I think it helped. I feel somewhat normal but I never really learned how to cope. 

I just need help. Or some advise....or encouragement.";1
1078;1078;2145_ptsd;"PTSD? I’m not sure (to scared to tell my mom that I may have it) I am not sure what it is but it may be ptsd...
(Sorry if there is bad grammar or anything I didn’t want to go over it)[sorry if I repeated my self in this it’s 12:40Am) What’s happening to me: I am 14 years old in my family my mom and her bf have fought a lot and still do fight. I live with my mom, her bf,my brother ,and my little sister.i am normally the only sibling at the house when they start to argue,well except for my little sister but she is always asleep when it happens. First they start off arguing and it get annoying bc Ik they r going to start fighting!...but then they start to yell loud enough for me to hear what they r saying.sometimes I tell them to stop or I just leave them alone bc they say I make it worse.Im not gonna say what they fight about... but it get pretty bad sometimes. Some of them have turned into physical fights,well most of them...and I always see all of it!and I have seen my mom get pushed and her finger get snapped/broken by her bf.she obviously has to fight back for self defence so she does..but he try’s to convince her to give him another chance and that he will change.he says that every single time and yet he still haven’t changed.I even told my mom that...they suffer from alcohol education and my mom thinks that’s the only way she can fall asleep.and some times she gets black out drunk and gets mad at me easy and when I say something that makes her upset... she takes it out on me and if not me her bf mostly her bf tho.. but some fight have scared me half to death bc I thought it was gonna end up in death. I thought one of them was gonna get killed.And if they r fighting downstairs I can hear them hitting each other if it’s physical or if they r going at each other or push each other and it makes a loud noise, like a bang on the ground or something.
But the things I’m experiencing (the after effects) they don’t know about...
Let me explain.
So I have bad anxiety(I haven’t rly been diagnosed with it but my mom know I have it and it’s rly bad to the point where I have anxiety attacks) but I always get triggered when I hear a big stomp upstairs, I always think it’s them fighting again and I get rly scared, but when I go up it’s just my siblings playing around,and I have to try and clap down.
(Loud bangs,slap sounds ,yells,other noises)scare me anxiety kicks in right away. Also sometimes I wake up and I think they are fighting again but I go down and they are sleeping and it’s just the tv,but it sounded like they are fighting.so I Can’t rly go back to sleep easy. Or if they are talking loud r sometimes just talking Normally and I’m upstairs in my room it’s sound like they are arguing and my anxiety get triggered and I feel like I want to cry,even when my mom is talking on the phone she kinda talks loud a lot bc I think she is losing hearing a little,so she talks a little louder than needed and it triggers me bc I keep thinking I hear them arguing but it’s just them talking normally.
I have watched this YouTube video and there where parents arguing in it and I immediately started crying bc it gave me some kinda flash back ig and it sounded exactly like there fighting. Sometimes I can’t sleep especially when they argue. And when I’m class the topic of abuse or any kind of toxic family topic come up I have to leave the class and clam down. It also doesn’t help that my neighbour has bad anxiety and screams at night sometimes and I wake up rly scared bc I think my they are fighting. I don’t know exactly what to call it bc I don’t want to diagnose my self but I think it could be ptsd and yes it trauma I have gone through other things in my life as in seeing someone get stabbed but I don’t worry about those as much because I can’t remember them as much as what I am going threw rn... if u read this that is my story and thanks for taking the time to see what’s happening this is my first time posting on here pls don’t judge me &lt;3";1
573;573;542_ptsd;"Pulled over today and had a panic attack (NSFW) Not sure if this needs a TW or not but my post talks about cops, car accident and depression.

So, quick background, I have PTSD and panic disorder (r/t PTSD). Some of the PTSD is r/t a bad car accident I was in and the other part was childhood trauma (not getting into that now). Just started therapy a few months ago for the first time after really bad depression, dissociation, and day/nocturnal panic attacks and flashbacks.  

As the title says, heading back from work and I got pulled over on the highway. Officer said I was speeding. I've been dissociating (nightmares/lack of sleep/stress from PTSD) more frequently and have no clue what happened before that time.

Anyways, officer walks up to my passenger side and I started to hyperventilate, shake uncontrollably and cry. So bad that I couldn't even form sentences or pull out my wallet. I have the say, I got lucky with the most understanding cop (not enough to get out of the ticket). Not only did he wait patiently, but he kept asking if he could do anything to help. If he could call anyone, get me an ambulance, do anything, etc. I managed to tell him in the midst of it all that I have PTSD and panic disorder and I was having a panic attack. He kept telling me it was okay and to take my time. 

Honestly, I dont know what I would have done had he been a douchebag because I literally could not control myself and I felt like the panic attack would have been way worse than it was. I kept having bad flashbacks while he was back in his car (from the cause of my PTSD) and was still basically hyperventilating when he came back. I felt so stupid the whole time because I couldn't calm myself the f down, but having him say ""it's okay, just breathe,"" was really helpful in the moment. 

Took a while to actually start driving again and semi process that but I guess I just felt like I needed to share this to people who might get it? Idk. It's frustrating losing chunks in my day, especially for something like this. I'm still feeling ""off"" even though that was an hour ago. Kinda glad I have a therapy session at 1.

But still, I'm having ""minor"" flashbacks a couple times a day and intrusive thoughts and memories all the time. The nightmares are worse too. It sucks sleeping in the bed a trauma occurred in. 

My therapist is too far away to get to, as well as elderly, so I can't risk that due to the people constantly in and out of my house I may be a carrier and infect her.

Anyways, I was hoping someone who has progressed further in therapy than I to give some tips on how to cope? I could google but I figured people who have experience with my specific situation would have better tips, or things a professional or person onliene may not have considered as helpful.

471;471;444_ptsd;"Questioning I’ve never been diagnosed with ptsd but I’m wondering if it’s possible I could have it...

I’ve been dealing with pretty bad emotional manipulation/abuse since I was a child (22 years of it) and recently had a very bad run in with my aunt where she cornered me. I don’t want to get into details too much (it triggers me), but it was a lot of the usual stuff (my father and his side of the family blame my mom and myself for the lack of relationship with them when they’ve never tried to have one at all, I can never do anything right, etc...). This also led to her talking to some people who are pretty important to me and getting them successfully on her side. 

None of this came with any threat of harm, the most she did was grab me (literally) and pull me into a hug. But I have depression, anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, and ocd and just her cornering me sent everything off the walls. I was suicidal that night, numerous panic attacks, etc... lots of fun.

I don’t know if any of this would be enough to trigger ptsd or not, but I feel like I have it(??)

I keep getting definite flashbacks (mostly auditory, but sometimes it feels like a bad movie I can’t turn off) (these also come with terrible headaches), I dissociate bad when things that remind me of this whole mess are even brought up, I have been having the worst panic attacks of my life when something that reminds of this is brought up, I’ve been having terrible nightmares related to this, I can’t go or even think about going near where it happened without shutting down, I have changed my number to prevent them from contacting me because they were trying to... I could go on for hours...

I’m a mess and it’s only been getting worse. Would this situation causing me to feel so intensely suicidal and continuing to bring up those feelings for months now (this has been dragged on for close to 4 months at this point) be enough to tip me over?? I feel like it doesn’t qualify trauma wise but I feel like I have every other symptom in the book...

2 weeks before her birthday I was camping with family having a great time. I had felt off for most of the summer as I usually do. All of my kids have summer birthdays and it’s always a major push and pull of my emotions. Long story short, my 17 year old nephew and I were having a conversation that turned a bit heated, but nothing crazy. And then he suddenly shouted something that triggered me. Like, TRIGGERED. I lost it, screamed at him (completely out of character for me) I don’t remember almost any of it, drama ensued with a few other members of my family, things got a bit physical with my sister (again NOT ME), I was completely out of myself.

They’re still human beings, I love them and know they have feelings. But, they have absolutely zero feelings towards me or my younger bro and sis. 

My father is now in assisted living,  he started getting more fucked up than usual  after they divorced, long story short. He ended up boarding himself up on a house with all his furniture and clothes thrown out claiming to be working for the ICA. 

I will be completely honest with you. I truly wish I could just look at this situation and laugh knowing that this man has destroyed my ability to ever be able to trust or have emotional connections with anybody , but deep down I still love him because I know he is sick (and was from the beginning) 




So my mother  was a decent mother when her and my father together, but after they divorced she started partying with a lot of trashy men. She would neglect my brother and sister (I lived with grandparents) and not buy them groceries except for chips and she would sit in her home all day with her boyfriend and shoot heroin. 



But, she claimed she was a new person, and I gave her a chance. Over time I’ve developed a problem myself, so I contributed, but what you did to me this time has helped me to look at you with more rage than ever. But I love you still and hope everything works out for you I really do.

84;84;386_ptsd;"Re-diagnosed two days ago and scared. I saw a psychiatrist yesterday for the first time ever, and after we talked, I was told I have PTSD, I suffer from childhood neglect, and I use alcohol and marijuana as coping mechanisms. This was scary. I cried, a lot. 

Now I knew I had PTSD since I was 13 when one traumatic event in my life happened. But I never realized that it didn’t just.. go away. As soon as I was happy again (3 sessions in), my parents decided that was good enough and I was well adjusted. No one ever talked about what this meant for me long term. And over my life, before and after 13, many traumatic events have happened. And finally I sought help for what I thought was just anxiety. Instead here I am being told I will need to take Zoloft or other antidepressants for the rest of my life to help curb all the emotions and outbursts I have. And I’m scared. And I wish the people close to me understood how scared I am because I know there’s so much more I’m going to go through.

592;592;470_ptsd;"Reaction / Anxiety as-if I'm a young boy. Mindfulness to counter act / accept? NSFW Trigger I grew up with an alcoholic father that would beat mother. When I was in my teens I had to fight him make him stop. I'm not a person that likes to fight, not my thing but had no choice. As kids my sisters and I would tackle him to the floor. This could be anytime of the night, no telling when he would explode.

Now in my late 40's I still have instant sense of dread if I thing my boss is pissed, or someone is angry or slamming something.

The fight, flight, freeze response kicks in and a flood of anxiety and brain foq.

I have working more so now on acceptance of the feelings instead of pushing those down, still I find my inclination to thing WTF is wrong with me (I know the cause) and want to battle these emotions and get them out of my life.

588;588;243_ptsd;"Realistic nightmares that don’t end on waking. For the past 4 years, I have been dealing with sleep disturbances related to my PTSD. The one I had tonight has me desperate for help or advice, maybe even just a comment or two from someone who has dealt with similar issues.  

*edit: not being able to sleep has resulted in a lot of googling. Perhaps instead of a nightmare, this is a “
Hypnagogic Hallucination” 


About once a week I am woken up by a “nightmare” (calling it this for lack of a better term.) The nightmare is always brief and is set exactly in my setting (my room, the hotel I’m staying in, etc.) It’s hard to call it a night mare because it occurs as I’m waking from sleep, but in the moment it feels as though I’m waking because of the thing happening in the nightmare. 

For example, tonight I woke with a start and saw a man peeking his head into my bedroom. My door was ajar and I clearly saw a mans face, leaning over and peering into my room. I yelled out (actually yelled, I was awake at this point) “what are you doing?” Or “who are you?” I’m not sure. But I grabbed my phone, dialed 911 and jumped out of bed and turned on the light. It was as I was jumping out of bed I recognized this might be another situation where I was having a nightmare, so I didn’t call 911. But 80% of my brain was still full on functioning as if there was an intruder in my home. I literally went as far as to grab a knife and check every inch of my home. I stood in my entry way with the knife and phone in my hand for a good 10 minutes trying to reason with myself that it wasn’t real. It’s hard to describe how my brain felt so torn. One part of me was constantly aware that it wasn’t real, but there was and is this part of me that can’t shake how real it felt. 

Even now, I am in bed with every light on and I can’t sleep. Logically, nobody is here. But I am terrified and the adrenaline and fight-or-flight dump I just got has me completely freaked out. I’m convinced if I turn off the lights and relax, it will happen again or I was wrong and it was real and I’m about to get murdered. 

I have never had the effect of one of these episodes last this long. Normally they are more vague. I wake to the “knowledge” that someone is there, but I’ve never actually had a full on hallucination. 

Has anyone experienced this? Maybe I need to finally seek professional help. It’s getting out of control.

I’m at the end of the line. I know it and I know it’s been coming. My bosses call and insult me.  I have no friends.  I have estranged myself for my family.  My neighbors start doing dishes at 5am and they just finished dishes at 12am.  My other neighbor hits slapshots in his back yard on and off every 20 minutes all day.  I wear my 33dB shooting ear plugs and my 35 dB shooting ear muffs almost all day and I can’t bloxk the noise out.

My hand is bleeding from punching my phone trying to break it from all the sleep deprivation.

154;154;579_ptsd;Recent c-ptsd diagnosis. Looking for support. Hello, recently I was diagnosed with c-ptsd. In my childhood from the ages of 12-17 I repeatedly experienced sound torture by my alcoholic father and was severely emotionally neglected. I’m looking to find resources / a community to connect to. I want to know others who have experienced this and who deal with triggers etc. I may have loved with this for my entire adult life, but the diagnosis is new. With the diagnosis I want something good to come out of it rather than just feeling like a ton of bricks just hit me.;1
1151;1151;1964_ptsd;"Recently Diagnosed So yesterday I had my mental health feedback with the psychologist at my city’s youth wellness centre and I got diagnosed with two mental health disorders.

The first one which I was expecting (due to my background in psych) was Illness Anxiety Disorder which is what I’ve been diagnosed with. It means that I tend to think of the worse when it comes to any little physical symptom I have and it can panic attacks. 

Now this is where I was surprised with the second diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which I did not expect at all. I was in literal shock and felt like, “wait, but I only had one traumatic experience in my life, how can I have PTSD” and I didn’t realize that all my intrusive memories, avoidance of areas, social events and certain types of people, hell my negative changes in my mood, behaviour and way of thinking is because of this.

Now, I’m not going to list my trauma because it’s NSFW, and I merely just wanna talk about my reaction to my diagnosis because I’m still in shock and processing it.

But I honestly thought I was depressed. Not traumatized. I honestly kept minimizing my pain because I believed that people have gone through worse things than me but for something that I have gone through to affect my behaviour and cognition to the point it affects my daily routine is still shocking.

I don’t know how to feel about this to be honest. I didn’t even expect this.";0
1007;1007;2458_ptsd;"Relationship problems caused by trauma Hi!

I had a very hard time during my childhood. My mom was mentally ill and beat me and my siblings on a daily basis and my dad beat my mom often in front of us children. My mom yelled at me for everything: If I laughed to much, If I cried, if I was angry so basically when I showed any emotion at all. If I did well in school (A:s were the only acceptable grade) helped her by being her emotional support as soon as I came home from school aka listening to her problems etc she would not beat me. But as soon as I did the slightest wrong she beat me and told me that she wished that she had just done an abortion etc 

I remember that my mom used to beat me when I was 4-7 years old just because I was so ugly. She pulled my hair and slammed me into a wall and she beat me and cried at the same time and yelled that I was a disappointment in every way. She forced me to have my hair up in a high ponytail or else she would beat me and pull my hair. I am born with a large forehead but the high ponytails only made it worse (I never wear my hair up now bc is how large of a forehead I have) I was also bullied because of that and because everyone knew that they beat me at home so in school they knew that I was an easy target, I remember just laying in my own piss one time because I was so scared after being beaten in school and scared of going home knowing that my mom would beat me because I pissed my pants. 

In conclusion my childhood sucked and that has caused a lot of problems now that I am a young adult F21, especially in my relationship. Me and my BF M21  has been in a relationship for 2,5 years and he is wonderful. The problem is that I am so insecure, I can worry that he will meet someone better if he goes away to work or just goes to buy some groceries. I am constantly feeling as if I am not enough and that he will leave me for anyone because I see other people as better than me, like I really mean every human I meet. I have a lot of anxiety and have a hard time talking to him about this, I really try to and are not actively refusing to talk but I often just don’t know how to describe it. I also don’t want to control him or let my anxiety make him shitty because it is not his fault, he has never given me any reason to even be worried but still I feel like shit. I feel sad sometimes and jealous when he hangs out with friends but I never tell him that he should not hang out whit them and he hangs out with them despite me having panic attacks and feeling as if I suck and that he will find someone better etc etc etc 

I am 100% aware that my feelings are not valid, I am loved but I just can not feel it and believe it. I go to trauma focused therapy (PTSD) so I am working on it and by BF knows about it and we always talk about it. He usually hugs me and tells me that he loves me etc and I just lay in his arms crying like a baby and knowing that my feelings are stupid but just can not make them go away.

So, Reddit or r/ptsd what do I do and am I the only one who feels like this?

I love my BF so extremely much and I really want to grow old with him and have kids and be together through everything but I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. As if I should leave him before he leave me and that this is an example of how fucked up and unworthy of love I really am. I just don’t want to hurt him and I know that my heart would shatter into pieces without him but if that is what is better for him then I want that. He says that he is happy and we really are happy most of the time but this ruins so much. 

And also, during one year I had this thing were I bought stuff on credit and it started out as what I thought a one time thing but then I used it as a coping mechanism. During that time I did not really understand that it was bad but when I realized about 6 months ago I knew that I needed to talk to my BF about it but I did not want him to leave me so I held it a secret for three more months and then I finally told him. I have ruined his trust in me now. I have never lied about anything and neither has he that has been like the most important thing in our relationship but now I ruined it.  We are trying to work through it and he says that he wants to be with me. 

I am a fuck up and just want to break up with my BF and kill myself because he would be happier without me. I really don’t know what to do anymore, I am so tired of myself";1

779;779;2403_ptsd;"Requesting advice for anxiety around men... Hello humans, 

Below is a non-graphic summary of my current predicament and I was hoping to gain some advice!

I work in the live production world in general - concert/theatrical touring shows specifically - and I am 26 years old. This interest of mine began in high school when I had the opportunity to participate in our school's theater program for which I built sets, hung lights, and operated audio. This was also my first co-ed experience as from age 4 to 18 I went to an all girls school. To put on theater productions, however, we would work with the all boys school across the street. While I did well in theater back then, I was often ignored by the other students and teachers as they all came from the boys school and weren't sure how to interact with me... I think. Even when I became a vital participant in making productions happen, I kept to myself because I was also put off by the social dynamic of the boys.

I pursued this in New York City where I went to college during which time being the only woman on a production crew was also the norm. In 2013 and 2015 respectively I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body. The earlier was while working at a music festival, the later was during an off campus Black Student Union event. At those times I was eager to put those experiences behind me and forget about it however still fell into a sort of social anxiety/paranoia from 2015-2017 at which point I left New York City taking the freelancing rhythm of my life on the road. I was based out of Maryland that summer yet traveled to festivals all over the country for the job I had. Then I spent the next several months out in Virginia where I attended a great church with a female pastor and a congregation that consisted of about twenty women and two men. The community there was a big catalyst for me pulling myself back together.

After that I applied for and accepted my first permanent job in a management position at a concert venue in Washington DC but in the eight months I was there received progressively unnerving approaches from one of the male staff members. That compounded with my desire to get back on the road touring prompted me to quit. On top of all that, working with the same large group of men day to day made me more paranoid than working with men in passing on my typical 1-3 month gigs. However I assumed that it might've just been a symptom of the overall environment of that workplace.

Currently I am on my longest tour yet: an 11 month contract that began in July 2019. By this point I noticed the overwhelming pattern that I am only able to feel relaxed around women. I'm responsible for all the logistics of the tour unit. I'm the one who dictates who rides in each car and who is where on each bus. For all of these I've made it so I'm only with women whether that be in a car or in a certain area of the bus. However my fellow managers are men and recently I was forced to change the car assignments due to a change in our overall production schedule. Because of this I share an office with them in each arena or theater we go to. The crew, as per usual, is also mostly men. While things were mostly fine from July-November, since December I've been developing a growing sense of anxiety around my coworkers for seemingly no good reason. This culminated two weeks ago with me having a panic attack from sitting between two of them on a four hour plane ride during which they were asleep most of the time which resulted in lots of accidental physical contact and being breathed on.

I've been averse to physical contact my whole life but since college it evolved into more of an acute fear. Because of this I modified my wardrobe so that everything but my face and hands was covered at all times creating a bit of a buffer or even a deterrent.

My main frustration now is that these men are not doing anything. They are of no threat to me. Yet my body is reacting as if they were constantly. Due to the nature of my job I'm practically living with these people. Because of all this I'm searching for methods or strategies to make these feelings stop.

Any advice would be appreciated!";0

His past.

Which eventually found out he tried to kill him self in service and his only coping methods is isolation, his cat, video games, and anti depressants.

He is quiet and clean. Good room mate. Likes to talk every now and then.

But I feel that he could blow any minute and if he loses his job that could be the trigger.

My first reaction was I have a friend whose a vet and great person who offered to reach out to my room mate. He refused the help. My friend said to suggest This local non profit that helps
Vets to him. He refused to use them as help as well. 

I honestly don’t think there is much I can do
If he doesn’t want help. It’s depressing for me to watch some one self destruct. Especially when I know there is ways for prevent it. 

Maybe in time he will trust me more and reconsider the resources I’ve suggested. 

He said I’m the first room mate he has had who cleans up apparently and has shown a genuine interest to his issues.

I need to vent to someone who understands. 

I have C-PTSD from prolonged childhood trauma. It’s been a terrible struggle to keep my shit together and live as normal of a life as I can.  Several years ago I attempted to go to school to get my degree. 

There, I was raped and beat up at a party. This triggered a downward spiral that led to a suicide attempt that got me kicked out of school. I lost my job, my relationship and ended up homeless for a while. I was a wreck and unable to keep even a simple restaurant job. 

I’ve spent the last few years clawing my way out of this pit. I forced myself to get through a shitty retail job even if it meant vomiting and crying every day before work. It was fucking hell. I only made it due to the kindness of some wonderful people. Sheer gratitude that someone cared enough to try to help me gave me what I needed to make it. 

Today, I have a career I am proud of. I am almost entirely out of debt. I am in a healthy and stable relationship. Until tonight I felt like I was finally moving on with my life. 

Today, I took a big step and decided to go back to school and take one class. Part of enrollment involves watching a graphic video about sexual assault, harassment and domestic abuse. 

I was completely taken off guard by how upset this video made me. I started sobbing in the middle of Starbucks. It was humiliating. 

My partner was really sweet and made me feel a bit better with a mix of r/corgi videos and hugs. But I just can’t shake it. I’m shaking right now. I am having flash backs and intense hyper vigilant reactions. 

I feel like someone just kicked me off a ledge and I am so angry. I’m angry that this is the establishments response to the nightmare I went through. I am angry that I was dismissed and discarded in my time of need. I am angry that I am forced to relive it as part of the price of admission to get my life back. And most of all, I am angry at myself for being so fragile. I am scared that everything I have worked for could be gone in an instance and I could be back on the street. I don’t know what to do. ";1

Also, I’ve only just turned 14 and I’m slightly concerned that they’re not going to take me seriously/think I’m faking for attention. It doesn’t help that I’ve never met this doctor before (my regular one was fully booked :/).

I’m posting here because I’m looking for you people’s experiences with talking to doctors about this kind of thing, because I’m really worried. 

(I’m in the UK, if that makes any difference. Also sorry if this sub doesn’t really fit, I was going to post in /r/mentalhealth but I decided this instead).";0
261;261;790_ptsd;"Seizure control Hi. I was recently diagnosed a few months back with grand mal and tonic-clinic seizures after abruptly stopping a high dose medication I need for nightmares (not intentionally).
I was also officially diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy. I think I have the aura (the feeling of hitting the lottery, or feeling like I’m in heaven, or feeling like I’m madly in love) and then they downward spiral into someone I love is dying in front of me and I can’t do anything to save them. Then I let out the scream. Then I seize.

The last one was pretty bad and now I need namenda.
So... we’re using topamax. And weed. 

Anyway.. does anyone have any recommendations for strains? I think if I can smoke immediately when I feel my aura, hitting the lottery, I can take 2 puffs and hopefully avoid the downward spiral? Maybe?";0
999;999;1729_ptsd;Sent this to a friend who didn’t believe me about my ptsd Hey so I was thinking about our conversation about our PTSD and I realized, all my life since ____  kissed me, people have been downplaying what I’ve been through. I have had very traumatizing experiences. Ending up in the hospital as a result of self-harm, and being rejected by a guy. I was very objectified and was rejected a lot when I was on [dating site]. I already feared men since _____, and now I’m scared to get close to a man in a romantic sense because I have flashbacks several times a day about how I felt when I was rejected and objectified in the past. My flashbacks haven’t been as intense since taking my medications, but the paranoia is still there. I feel very threatened when I am around men now. Then I sense that they are uncomfortable because they know I am uncomfortable, and so my anxiety around them increases even more. Plus, my relationship with my mom hasn’t been strong in the sense that I feel like she is always peering over my shoulder, and for good reasons. For instance, she read my diary when I was 14 and she found out other things about my personal life that led me to blaming myself and feeling guilty. when I was really young, I was exposed to things that gave me the impression that men sexualized women and it has made it difficult for me to trust men. Just thought I’d let you know, cause I know that you said “nothing traumatic happened in my life.”;1
252;252;521_ptsd;"Seriously struggling I have severe C PTSD due to unrelenting traumas throughout my life.

I have a bunch of debt, no sense of self, university dropout and no idea what I want in life. 

The only thing I want to do is travel but I don't make enough. I want to backpack Europe but even for that I'd need a good few thousand. 

Today, I got fired from my job. I wasn't the best employee but I spoke french and English which most others couldn't and I we had occasional french customers, I was early, I was fast on the cash register, I followed the dress code and didn't stand around talking for 40 mins where most others barely did that... managers included.. 

There were 4 managers and I had no problem with the first 3. The 4th one was a narc that totally triangulated the other 3 against me and I noticed a shift in their attitudes towards me after she decided to have a vendetta against me. She would constantly minimize me, be passive aggressive, push only my breaks back but no one else's and nit pick me to a T. Other employees agreed that they saw this happening. 

Today I woke up feeling amazing after a deep sleep meditation on YouTube- only to get fired as they told me right before my shift. This really shook me and made my PTSD worse and I've felt like crap all day today... It was the only thing that helped me build motivation, my job. It's this constant cycle of me barely surviving and then other people tearing me apart. 

Ive suffered severe attachment traumas. I have never had parents there for me, never had true friends, never had a boyfriend or a true love interest in my life. I've been used by narcissists sexually, mentally and emotionally. My mom has used my mind against me. I can't find real friends. I can't even connect to my
True self it seems. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm in this trance like fog state and I can't think right. I need to get away from the narc mom I live with but I don't make enough and now being fired I definitely don't make enough.

I guess I should look for a new more full time job but it's really hard keeping a job because I keep a) attracting narcissists who can't be pleased or b) my depression and PTSD gets perceived as bitchiness/ laziness, despite that I do try. 

I guess being on meds would help but I don't know the necessary steps to obtain them without family doctor  ( I live in Ontario Canada) 

I was on risperidone for a bit when they thought I had schizophrenia but I don't have schizophrenia and risperidone just made me twitch/feel foggy/anxiety seared through the roof that I thought I was literally about to die/ and so on and I've read awful things about risperidone anyway. 

It appears I also have super low self confidence/internalized hatred for myself there for I feel guilty when I embrace myself as if I always owe people something and I seek my confidence in external circumstances that always come crumbling down due to narcissists. ";0

365;365;152_ptsd;"Sexual assault TW...Stuck in the house with my abuser, minor, nowhere to go. Advice plz? Throw away acc. So, my brother is 25 right now and I am turning 17 in May. When I was 7 he r*ped me and I didn’t tell my parents until October of 2018...Since then all that has happened it a switch of rooms because he used to have to walk through my room to get to his. He still lives with us because he has high functioning autism and can only really work at a grocery (as he is now). My parents don’t want him to work too much or he will no longer get disability and they’re scared he’ll have a fit at work and get fired even though he’s been working there for like 2 years and been fine.
We don’t have enough money to get him an apartment. My parents don’t think he could survive on his own, so I’m stuck living with him. 
Since I told he doesn’t talk to me or look at me. I do the same towards him. This was until maybe 3 months ago when he had an outburst and screamed at me saying I’m a “junkie lair who should finish what she started and kill yourself” (I used to smoke weed and have attempted suicide before). 
He’s had an outburst like this three times now where he yells at me while I lock myself in another room. Talked to my dad about it and he said unless he sexually touches me or punches me hard (not light shoving) they aren’t going to kick him out.
A week ago I was sleeping on the couch because it’s right by my parents room and makes me feel more sleep. He then went into the living room in the middle of the night and slept in the middle of the floor.
He’s being creepy. He yells at me like once every week and half calling me a lair etc. Being in a house with him without going to school or to friends makes me feel terrible.
I would stay at a friends but my mom has severe COPD so I can’t because of the virus.
I don’t think I can do anything. I’m only allowed to leave the house for a 2 hour walk every other day. I’m unable to function well enough to get my schoolwork done. I feel terrible. I feel unloved by my parents even though I KNOW they love me, but they refuse to do anything! It makes me feel terrible! I don’t want to hurt myself but I almost want to go to a psychward so I don’t have to be here! Or run away and live under a bridge! Or something! I feel so fucking trapped.
If you read all of this please at least comment “that’s fucked up” so I know I’m not crazy for feeling so terrible because my parents are acting like it’s not big deal while also saying they believe me and it’s making me feel nuts. 
Sorry this is so long and badly written. Thank you for reading. Any advice is appreciated. Btw CPS already knows and also did nothing because they couldn’t I guess. My parents have looked into assisted living as well.";1
496;496;874_ptsd;"Sexual traumitization and in need for treatment. This isn't actually for me (F21) this is for my best friend and roommate (20F). i met my roommate in high school and we quickly became best friends. while we had a sleepover one night, we watched a movie that had an explicit sex scene in it, and she started to cry and wail to the point of nearly passing out. i was so terrified i almost got my parents until she begged me not to. we stayed up for hours talking about her past. ever since she was a young child, her parents were swingers, and would force her to watch them having sex; whether it would be just them, a threesome, gang bang, house party, etc. i don't know how they found the most corrupted people to actually let a child watch them participate. due to this, my friend has severe PTSD. anything sexual is off-limits to her. Anything sexual that shows up in conversation or on TV makes her cry and scream. I cant tell you the amount of nightmares she has had in the past. She believes that sexually-active parents don't love their children and that if a child died, the parents would just have a sex party on that child's corpse. that terrifies me. that is far from normal. that is demented thinking. i am pregnant myself, and as a woman who is *very* sexually active, i can tell you that that child is my number one priority and that even though I haven't met him yet, my boyfriend and I would give our lives up just so he can live happy. i'm afraid to have sex with my boyfriend because she's almost always here, and if she even hears us having sex, i don't know what she'll do. she was given to a foster care in sixth grade and her parents were put in prison for fifteen years for child abandonment and sexual abuse involving a child. Her foster family didn't care for her either. She never had a safe childhood. i knew she was a little off when we first met, but it only started to get worse. We tried therapy, medical marijuana, and she's currently on medication that i have to keep because i'm afraid she'll overdose. The other day she relapsed so hard, i caught her slicing her thighs open because she looked up sexually-active parents and getting caught be their kids.

925;925;1717_ptsd;"Shamed about my artwork I was abused as a child, a teenager, and an adult. I’ve had two other traumas related to death/fear of being killed. I’m so exhausted. 

I’ve been creating artwork and posting it on Instagram which is very out of character for me. I never use social media and my world is very small due to my ptsd. I barely leave my house and when I do, I spend most of my time with my auntie who I love. 

A lot of my art features women alone, peaceful in their bedrooms in their pajamas or without a top on. I never intended it to be sexual at all. They’re not doing sexual poses or anything, just relaxing in their room alone. It’s peaceful to me and I feel like they accept their bodies which I am trying to do myself. 

My auntie told me she doesn’t think I should be putting myself out there like that, and that it’s inappropriate. I was able to shake her comment off. Then, a week later, her boyfriend told me “with all the trauma you’ve been through, you should not be drawing topless women”.

I immediately started crying, left, and sobbed on my drive home. I feel so much shame. 

It’s not my body’a fault I was raped or abused. My body didn’t do anything wrong.

185;185;1092_ptsd;"Should I go for a diagnosis? TLDR: Sorry for the long post just looking for clarification on if what I have been experiencing through my teenage years is somehow connected to PTSD

I'm currently 17 years old and after research I seem to have almost every single symptom of PTSD. The main reason I found this is because anytime I am yelled at by anyone (mainly parents) I instantly go into full panic mode and it feels like my whole body freezes up. This happens even when I know they aren't trying to yell at me but are just raising their voice. The reason I am confused is because I cannot remember a traumatic event in my life that would be substantial enough to cause something like this. The symptoms I experience that may or may not be connected to PTSD include:

Fear and avoidance of situations where either being yelled at or being made fun of is a possibility
Extreme social anxiety to the point where it is difficult for me to make new friends outside of my group and has caused me to avoid relationships because I am afraid of rejection/being laughed at by the school
Paranoia involving being attacked or bad things happening to family members even though I live in a suburb that never has crime
Difficulty sleeping with no specific cause, usually at night I just am constantly in my thoughts playing out millions of different scenarios in my head
Feelings of isolation, mainly that I am somehow not like everyone else because of all these symptoms and my ADHD diagnosis, this causes me to isolate myself and run away from problems such as walking away from a conversation with my parents if I get yelled at for something
And finally the strongest symptom I have is constantly replaying bad moments in my life or imagining bad things that have never happened

Unrelated to these symptoms I find that I struggle with addiction/self damaging behavior as just 6 months ago I finally was able to stop smoking weed daily (after a consecutive 4 months straight) due to the fact that it relieved many of these negative feelings. The only reason I was able to stop was because I was caught being high by my parents and immediately had a panic attack that ended up with an ambulance ride to the hospital.";0
363;363;615_ptsd;Should I return to the scene of the trauma or not? Last year I had a severe, prolonged medical crisis. I was in and out of the hospital over the entire year and have severe PTSD from a lot that happened. My condition is lifelong and requires annual checkups to track growth (not cancer but behaves similairly). It's my first progress checkup since the initial crisis coming this week. I need to undergo a series of tests and scans at the hospital thatost everything happened at followed by a visit with the doctor that treated me. All of this over the course of two days. Now my wife and I are in the middle of a cross country move. We're moving in about 4 weeks and am wondering if it would be best for my PTSD to get my checkup after we move. The scans and tests can be done anywhere and in today's day and age my doctor can review them and consult with me remotely. Also it's not going to hurt me to wait the few weeks. I'm non symptomatic. I'm just thinking more in terms of what would be best for my PTSD. Should I get everything done at the original hospital this week and face my fears? Or would it just do more damage to my fragile mental state and early stages of recovery? I don't want to feel like I'm running away but I don't want to cause more harm by going. Not sure what to do.

He has told me the event that caused his PTSD and told me he's only told one other person. I've been very understanding and have never asked him any questions, just listen when he brings it up. I'm trying to respect his boundaries as well and I decided to do some research on PTSD so that I could have a better understanding of what he is going through. I researched it for hours and I learned a lot, but obviously I could never understand anyone's actual experience. Part of me wants to tell him that I have a better understanding of PTSD now, because he's so scared that I'll think he's crazy,  but I'm scared he might think I see him as weak or broken and that's why I researched it. The truth is I think he's so strong and not broken at all. I just wanted to get some feedback on how I should proceed.;0

I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of my trauma not being taken seriously. In 6th grade, around September, my school went on lockdown. It was real. It ended up being a miscommunication. We found out later that there was no actual threat in the school, but I thought there was. I spent an hour and a half huddled up in my creative writing classroom fearing for my life, having no idea what was going on, having reason to believe someone was in the school with a gun or a knife or something. I was 11 years old and mentally preparing myself to be murdered. I wasn't though. No one was remotely physically hurt in anyway. There wasn't actually a shooting or anything. We just thought there was. I thought there was. No one understands that. They all think ""well nothing actually happened, it couldn't have been that scary"" or ""you can't really have PTSD from that"". No one understands how much being in that situation really hurts. I often say ""silence is scarier than gunshots"". I almost wish I could hear an attacker, then at least I would have some idea of what was going on. People were locked outside during the lockdown, too. We heard loud banging as they tried to get inside. We thought it was the person who would kill us. I thought I was going to die.

Recently, people keep telling me I have borderline. Which is incredibly frustrating because they're not my psychiatrist. I did bring it up with him, and he brushed it off because symptoms are similar to autism. 

They're main issue, I guess, is I am prone to anger. Part of it is my autism where I generally mask all day (act neurotypical to hide my differences further) and that puts me more on edge and prone to a meltdown. Its something I'm working on. However, I got my hands on a DSM V, and was looking at further symptoms. For PTSD it said that child abuse may lead the person to have issues with anger. I was like, ""wow, that's me!""

717;717;1786_ptsd;"Significant other of 17.5 years has been diagnosed with PTSD for a year now due to traumatic event (he’s a civilian). I’m at a loss. Some background information. He (32 m) and I (31 f) have been together almost 18 years now. We moved to our current location after I accepted a job position about two years ago, and he had his little brother move down about four months after that. We all got really close. Flash forward to October 2018.

He and his brother work out of town, on the morning of the incident his little brother was killed right in front of him for absolutely no reason, seriously, no reason. He blames himself, has been in and out of rehab centers (he uses illicit drugs, and most recently, alcohol) to numb himself and avoid reality. Our family lives about 14 hours from us, so really it’s just him and me. 

Please understand I am not trying to portray myself as a victim. I just honestly don’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to face what happened and work through the trauma, he just tries numbing it. Everything gets taken out on me. I listen, boy do I listen, to every detail of what happened that morning. I understand it is good for him to get it out, but I am not a licensed therapist. He refuses to see a professional. Lately, his drinking has increased so much he drinks straight liquor like it’s water and I become his verbal punching bag. He blacks out every night not remembering what he said/did. It’s getting to be a lot. 

I know this isn’t him, that it’s his PTSD. I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but in all honesty, I’m at such a loss. It’s a lot on my shoulders to take care of everything that isn’t related to him and his PTSD and then adding that on top of my regular responsibilities. I have no support from his family, it’s kind of like an out of sight out of mind ordeal. 

Honestly, at this point, I’m just looking for some help or guidance. Like I said, I don’t want the relationship to end, and his brother wouldn’t want his death to result in the either. But there is only so much I can do to help him without him getting the actual help he needs, professional help. What am I doing wrong? Are there things I could be doing different? Is it selfish to want to put “me” first in my own life?

525;525;798_ptsd;"Six years mostly stable. Backsliding for no apparent reason. I know it happens. Mostly a vent post. No one needs to fucking read this, the TL;DR is the title. I'm just starting to get this millenial thing where posting it here is mildly more comforting than journaling for inexplicable reasons.

Like I said, 6 years managing life pretty ""normally"" since leaving inpatient care after I had reached a nonfunctional point (PTSD is not my only mental illness). I have been in ongoing therapy and taking my meds. It's been up and down but I've rebuilt a full life that moves forward and remained functional to the degree that institutionalization hasn't been thought of again.

But then really the last 2.5 years or so something snapped in place and I got my symptoms under control in a way I never had before (therapy, consistent medication, and meditation). I've cut down on panic attacks like I never thought possible and largely eliminated most of my behaviors that scream from across the room ""that dude has anxiety!"". I've been moving past triggers with nothing but a blip in my blood pressure and a few moments of breathing. I've read entire books sitting with my back to an open bay window and completed meals at a leisurely pace in bustling open air restaurants. I've been so fucking proud of myself. I've researched and discussed in therapy and try, in a healthy way, to never let myself forget that I'm never ""cured"" and I understand that. 

But I had started to think about thinking about feeling that I could someday live in daily confidence I was done with relapses. You know.... just kinda live. How people do. [They do, right?]

Then two weeks ago, an accidental touch, fuck, an random ass brush, in the small of my back in a crowded bar launched a full on panic attack (made it to private bathroom to have it out, SO who knows it all was there and drove me home, could have been worse). There have been no life triggers for relapse. This is exactly the kind of trigger I've been handling. But this touch broke a dam somehow. In the last two weeks I've reacted to a host of my classic triggers so noticeably that coworkers and acquaintances and strangers are asking if I'm ok, and circle of friends who know what's wrong are exchanging looks and starting to prepare contingency plans for me in social outings again. It's spiraling so fast and I know part of the reason is that I'm feeding it by panicking about it, but how the fuck do you not do that? 

I ended up nonfunctional before not just because of the severity of my issues but because I have a lot of ""daily life"" triggers. I'm in hospitality management, low levels of ""normal"" and friendly touching- without warning, I'm ok with handshakes- are basically constant. If I continue to slip at this pace back to where I was 6 years ago I unquestionably cannot keep my job as is.

I can't even cook this week- one of my biggest things that had been so much more than a hobby and so healing it doesn't even make sense- because standing at the stove in our kitchen means you have your back to a door. [New apartment, we moved in last year and I said the door situation would be fine because it's a door exclusively to our own gated backyard, at the time I was OK enough for that knowledge to override the problem and I thought it was a good idea, immersion therapy wise or some shit.]

Like I said I know this isn't how it works but I'm so mad at myself that there's no *cause* for this. I've felt validated (enough) in the past for back slides after difficult life events and literal triggers like wrapping up legal and practical issues relating to my trauma. But everything is going fucking great lately. It just feels like my brain said ""pushing 3 years feeling safe? Long enough buddy!"" and shut that shit down because I don't deserve it. 

I know this can be gotten back under control. Therapy is once a month now, I haven't been back since this started but it's next week. I know it will help. I remember this hopelessness before and I can still remember the difference after letting treatment work. 

 I just feel like I either failed, or somewhere deep in my subconscious, gave up. I can't help but wonder if I subconsciously shut down whatever autonomic part of me has been constantly keeping vigilance because I want to be the old me again, and wallow in it because getting better is so exhausting, and affects my loved ones daily while me just being locked up lets them fucking live. [The fact that I have this pathetic narcissistic tendency is the other reason I ended up nonfunctional before, I'm aware of it. I leaned in back then and that weakness is always there.]

That's all. Hope y'all out there are doing better.";1

I was diagnosed with PTSD because I grew up in a very abusive home with drug addicts and alcoholics. My family is very twisted so I avoid them at all cost but my mother recently revealed that I ""may have been"" (her words) sexually assaulted by my uncle, who molested her. I witnessed him attempt to molest her when I was younger, so I don't doubt this.

He was a very abusive to my family (we lived with him on/off till I was 15) because he was a mean drunk and would cut phone cords and start physical fights with my grandparents and my mom. I remember he used to tie me up with duct tape and cover my mouth and would keep me in his room. I don't remember if anything happened but after my experience with sleep paralysis - I'm kind of messed up and feel like I do remember now. 

I hope I am making sense because I am on high-alert right now.

I felt my mind wake up but I couldn't move my body. I felt like something was in the room and it was trying to confine/take me with blankets. I felt it actually trying to confine me. I felt its hands touching me. At first, I thought it was little gremlins, but then I thought of my uncle, and I attempted to scream for help. I kept trying to move my body but I was stuck.

It's been 4 hours since that happened and I am terrified and I feel violated and sick. I'm not sure what is going on. But I feel alone, sad, scared, and like I don't want to try anymore. I just feel so sick and confused and like an epiphany exploded in my head.

My 14 year old body was now the product of a 45 year old man and the countless nights he snuck in my room. Then my 15 year old emotions only wanting it to stop but too afraid to end it. 
End it, was what I wanted but it won't stay in my past. End the tears when he leaves, they only come more. End the long nights of his encounters, but they come just as frequently just in a different form. End the pain in my body, the feeling of his breath on my neck, the feeling of hands over my mouth. The end... but it won't. 
It won't since I've been told it was my fault. It won't since he will be seen as an amazing man, while he hides the fact he's a monster. It won't since he lives happy and my family has a new person to gossip about. So it won't. 
I don't think this will ever be fair or justified but it's the price I get to pay for wanting to be loved. ";1

859;859;1987_ptsd;Small things keep giving me flashbacks. I have a friend in one of my classes who keeps touching me. He always plays it off as a joke, and he never hurts me, just pokes or squeezes my thigh gently sometimes. Also he puts his arm around me as a joke and some other stuff. I always try to laugh it off because I'm scared to draw attention to myself or sound dramatic/crazy. I was raped and sexually assaulted multiple times by my grandpa when I was younger and I keep having flashbacks when my friend touches me. I keep remembering how when I told my grandma what happened she told me not to tell anyone, that it wasn't a big deal. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, i get so anxious and uncomfortable when he touches me and I've tried to tell him to stop touching me in a nice way but he just ignores me.

698;698;2564_ptsd;"So Beyond Angry Right Now TW: Sexual Assault, politics, Kavanaugh. 

So, I just need to vent. I have been off Facebook for years but over the past year have gotten back on Facebook to see what my family is up to. During my time off Facebook I think being on Reddit has made me a bit bolder to speak up and say what's on my mind. 

Anyway, somebody shared an article about Kavanaugh that makes a very large leap to claim that all the accusers are lying. I realize there is very little evidence either way but this article was making very unfounded claims. So I started debating with the article sharer. 

However, someone unrelated who's cover photo was a picture of text that says ""I have PTSD - Pretty Tired of Stupid Democrats"" took it upon themselves to call me a stupid liberal and say I need a normal life and common sense. 

I think that cover photo might be one of the singularly most offensive things I've ever seen. Not to mention, my chance at a normal life was taken from me when I was raped, and have since had to struggle with PTSD. 

I just can't even express the rage it makes me feel right now. I have since removed myself from that conversation so that I can cool down, but how can people be so crass and mean? I guess I know how, people are terrible. But it just kills my already small faith in humanity. 

I guess I just needed to vent. What makes people think it's ok to turn an actual mental illness into a joke to attack people they disagree with?? Has anyone else seen this stupid picture before? Sexual Assault PTSD aside, I used to know a veteran with PTSD who was a Democrat. It's just that cover photo was so brazenly insensitive. 

I guess I just need a place to express my anger that isn't on that post.";0
89;89;400_ptsd;"So I walked past my rapist on the street this weekend I was sexually abused for about 6 months when I was 12 years old by this guy, and I haven't seen him in years (I never pressed charges or anything).

I've had lots of therapy and almost completely gotten over it apart from the very occasional panic attack when doing sexual activities with my current boyfriend. We've been together for just over a year now and he's amazing and so supportive, but I do still have some small issues.

But on Saturday, I was walking back from shopping in the town centre with my boyfriend, and I walked past him. He looks exactly the same as he did years ago, and I'm pretty sure he noticed me, and did that stupid hair flip that he always used to do. 

It was so weird, I just grabbed my boyfriend and walked past very quickly. I told him a couple of minutes later and he hugged me and told me it was okay etc, but I just felt so stunned.

I didn't really feel upset or anything, it was really strange, I'm still not sure what to think about it.

58;58;73_ptsd;So im 17 and I had a spinal AVM So about a year ago (September 18th to be exact) I was having some back pain. That pain escalated and after i tried getting up my legs weren't able to hold my body weight. After my dad tried to help me move around thinking it was a pinched nerve and he ended up getting me to the couch. He had me moving my legs up and down like i was marching while sitting hoping that would do something but all it did was keep me focused on the fact that more time went on the less i was able to use my legs and the less i could feel them at all. It happened in the spand of an hour. But i was off to the hospital and that kinda fades in and out. The last thing i remember was that damned room right before you go into surgery. Next thing i know is that im in urgent care and i cant feel my legs or move them at all. I have about a 6 inch incision on my back witb staples in and my family are in the room waiting for me to wake up. Fast forward to now. Im walkin and my feeling is not exactly up to par but its way better than what it was. Im coming up on the anniversary of it and I've been losing sleep rewatching everything that happened. All those memories and emotions flood back into my head and everytime i feel so scared just like when it all happened. So i thought id share.

765;765;2659_ptsd;"So, anyone have anything they'd like to vent about? CONTENT/TRIGGER WARNING: Detailed story of child abuse, near-death experiences, guns, animal death

I have PTSD from childhood abuse from my step-father (who I was raised to believe was my biological father) and from my mother who neglected me a lot throughout my life until I moved out.

I haven't lived with my mom and step-dad since 2011 and I still have vivid nightmares and flashbacks from my childhood.

One thing that I'd like to share with you all is a certain situation my step-dad put my family in. It was 2012, I was living with my grandparents, but went to Chuck E. Cheese with my mom, step-dad, and brother because my mom wanted me to go with them.
Everything was going okay until we left and got inside my step-dad's truck.

My step-dad has a permit to open carry a pistol, which I still have no idea how he was able to even get that gun, but then again, 'murrica. He caries that damn thing with him everywhere.

Anyways, we were all sitting in the truck, step-dad in driver's seat, mom in passenger seat, and my brother and me in the backseat. Out of the blue, my step-dad locks the doors of the vehicle and takes out his pistol. As soon as I saw him do this, I just thought to myself, ""great, we're all going to die now."" He pointed the barrel at our heads, smiling and waving his gun around like it was a toy. He almost never keeps the safety on.

""I could kill all of you right now, just put a bullet in all of your heads,"" he said, laughing, still waving the gun around.

""(S-D's name), please stop, you're scaring us!"" My mom cried.

He pointed the gun at her and told her, ""shut the fuck up!""

Then my mom said, ""this is why OP doesn't want to be around us anymore!""

My step-dad groaned and put away his pistol, claiming that my mom always has to ""ruin the fun"" and then drove me back to my grandparents' house.

About a year after he had gotten the gun (back in 2009), I was sitting in the living room watching War of the Worlds. Suddenly, he just pulled his pistol out in the living room, stood up, pointed the gun at me, and pulled the trigger. I screamed so loud and tried to cover myself up. I remember the feeling of the adrenaline rushing through my veins and feeling so helpless. Then, I heard him laugh at me and said, ""OP, stop being fucking ridiculous, the magazine's not even in!""

Well, he ended up accidentally killing his dog back in 2012. He took his sleeping pills before cleaning out his gun. The magazine was out, but there was a bullet stuck in the chamber. He accidentally pulled the trigger. It went straight through his arm chair and hit his dog in the head. She yelped slightly and tried to walk away before she slumped down and passed on. Luckily, I didn't have to witness that situation first hand (my mother had told me when I asked where the dog was when I was visiting her once).

That's not the only abusive thing that he's done, but it's been replaying in my mind ever since the school shooting in Florida.

The only ones I've told these stories to are my boyfriend, a couple trusted friends, and two therapists.

It terrifies me whenever people ask me how I feel about gun control. I feel like they will think I'm being ridiculous when I tell them I support stricter gun regulations, but honestly, if an abusive man with mental illness can LEGALLY get a firearm and threaten to shoot his family, pretend to shoot his own kid, and accidentally kill his dog with it, there should obviously be some sort of stricter regulations.

I haven't reported him. I've always been afraid to. My mom would always tell me as a child to not tell ANYONE that he abused me because she didn't want her kids taken away from her. That's still engraved in my brain, even to this day. Even the thought of reporting him gives me waves of anxiety.

He still has that gun and he still is legally allowed to open-carry. It's terrifying.";1
911;911;1831_ptsd;"Some of my classes are requiring class presentations and my symptoms have been taking over me ever since, presentations are one of most trigging things for me and not sure what to do I am in my final semester of college. I was lucky enough to dodge presentations for my first semesters and now I am in my last semester and some of my classes are requiring me to present a topic/chapter from a book (which I find incredibly odd and lazy of the professor) in front of the whole class! there is no way I can do this, especially with my severe PTSD,

Today our professor made us go up to the classroom and present our topics to the class and made us go up again to talk about our other assignment. Oh my goodness, I could not make eye contact with anyone, I kept my explanation very brief, my voice was shaking, I looked so pathetic up there, I felt embarrassed for myself. I am scared as hell to keep going to that class.

I know there is no way I can do a full presentation, my body is stuck in fight or flight mode, I cannot give a good explanation because I am too tense and cant concentrate because all pairs of eyes are on me which is very triggering. I tried practining, not caring what they think, all the positive talk people tell me and it still hasn't worked.  I think I may just have to drop my classes and maybe look for an online school to finish my degree. I feel stupid for thinking I could hack college with my mental health issues, I look and come across as a scared maniac, it so embarrassing.

should I try to tell my professors about it and see if I can try do an alternative assignment? I am very scared, one of my professor seem strict, she may not allow me. I have been feeling sick and nauseous everyday for weeks, its stuff like these that makes me wish I didn't exist!! :/";0
275;275;1189_ptsd;"Some things I've realized that help me with flash backs. What helps during a flashback?
*If you realize that you are in the middle of a flashback, consider the following tips:*

▪Tell yourself that you are having a flashback. Remind yourself that the actual event is over and that you survived.

▪Breathe. Take slow, deep breaths by placing your hand on your stomach and taking deep breaths. You should see your hand move out with the inhalations, and watch it fall in with the exhalations. When we panic, our body begins to take short, shallow breaths, and the decrease in oxygen can make you feel more panicked. Deep breathing is important because it increases the oxygen in your system and helps you move out of anxious state faster.
Return to the present by using the five senses.
Look around you. Make a list of the items in the room; count the colors or pieces of furniture around you. What do you see?

▪Breathe in a comforting scent, or focus on the smells around you. What do you smell?

▪Listen to the noises around you, or turn on music. What do you hear? 

▪Eat or drink something you enjoy. Focus on the flavor. What do you taste? 

▪Hold something cold, like a piece of ice, or hot, like a mug of tea. What does it feel like?

▪Recognize what would make you feel safer. Wrap yourself in a blanket, or go into a room by yourself and close the door. Do whatever it takes for you to feel secure.


1) Remind yourself again that the flashback is simply a flashback, that you're safe, and that it isn't really happening. 

2) Take deep breaths. Put your hand on your stomach and focus on the rise and fall of your chest. Focus on making your breathing as even as possible. 


3) Use grounding: Identify and desrcibe five things that are in the room you are physically in. Identify four things that you can hear in the room you are physically in. Identify and focus on three things that you can feel in the room you are physically in. Identify two things you can smell in the room you are physically in. Identify and focus on what you can taste.


Then, while doing one or all of these, make yourself feel safe. Mainly, go to a safe place and grab a few things that comfort you. Maybe call someone you trust.

408;408;893_ptsd;"Some thoughts on dissociation? Not sure if this sub is the right place. Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or ""go see a therapist"" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.

Okay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating/introspecting/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.

Either way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.

In particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.

There is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.

Now, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I ""jump into"" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. 

If that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: ""I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.""

Mind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.

This celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other ""weak needy"" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. 

Outside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.

Now, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or ""tricks"" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.

My thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out ""jumping into"" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.

Anyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.

181;181;111_ptsd;"Someone loves you I tried to take my life again yesterday. Took a few bars and chugged it down with beer before someone stopped me. I remember being carried to the car, a nurse putting me in a wheelchair and trying to rip out my IV. I got sick of being so scared of everything. 

My therapist tells me I have abandonment problems because of my trauma. That I’d rather snap at people and drive them away than be abandoned again. 

I have trouble believing most days that anyone cares about me. This condition has made me believe that I’m somehow unlovable and alienated from the rest of the world, and that any emotional interaction I have with another person is them taking pity on me. I think a lot of us feel that disconnection. 

Maybe someone is in the spot I was last night and if so, I just wanted to let you know that I love you. Someone cares.

543;543;920_ptsd;"sometimes I wish I was raped Now before you start typing about how I shouldn't say that and I could never want something like that to happen to me, I want you to hear me out.

When I was little. about 6 or 7ish, something happened to me. And ever since then I still don't know if I can call it sexual assault, sexual abuse, or just a bad experience. There are several reasons I don't know what to call it. I was young but so was he. He was four hears older but I know that he knew what he was doing. But at the same time he only would have been 10 or 11 at the time. I never said no, I never said stop, and when I told him he was heavy or that something hurt or was going too far he stopped. But yet again, I was only 6 or 7 and I just thought if felt good. I remember him telling me not to tell my mom or dad, and it happened more than once. I enjoyed it at the time though, It felt good. No intercourse actually happened, but there was a lot of grinding and touching. He had me watch him ""do his thing"" and asked if I would do it too and when I said no he didn't make me.

The thing is though, I still see this person all of the time and I will for the rest of my life probably. We have never talked about it, but I don't even know if he'd remember it. This person has always been violent and has a history of abusing my parents and me physically, along with ""anger management"" classes when he was about 10 or 13, I don't really remember. That's another thing. I don't really remember all that happened, it was over ten years ago. I remember some of it but not all of it.

Now this is why I wish I had been raped. When I was in the fifth grade I started self harming. Not cutting, I hadn't even heard of that. Instead I would dig my nails into my skin and scratch until I bleed, this happened whenever I thought about what happened because I thought I did something wrong. After I told my friend (Who I'm still extremely close with to this day) about it I kind of just forgot about it every few months until when I started to hit puberty and feel sexual about anything. This was about seventh grade. I had just learned what rape was and then I remembered what happened to me and I wrote it down in my diary. The nexy day I blacked it all out with a marker.

In eighth grade I had a male teacher for homeroom who taught many of my classes. I would feel constant anxiety when he walked around the room because even the thought of him coming behind me scared me so much I was shaking. Now the weird part was he was my favorite teacher and at the time my favorite adult. So sometimes I would stay up from lunch and talk to him about anxiety and such. But at the same time, I was scared out of my mind that he was going to do something to me. Now keep in mind, this was the most innocent, sweetest teacher, nicest adult and teacher I knew at the time, and yes he was a history teacher, fulfilling the stereotype. But Even though I trusted him more than pretty much anyone at the time, I still was in a constant state of fear when he walked around the room. I thought putting myself in uncomfortable situations like seeing him during lunch would help me to trust him more and it actually did. Things got better, even though I never did tell him what had happened when I was little. in eighth grade a started to scratch myself more and a few of my friends noticed. It was on and off but by then end of the year I had stopped.

When high school started I was a nervous wreck. I was starting a new school where I didn't know anybody. So obviously, little old me began to think that the first friend I made there would be my best friends, so I told a lot of people. By a lot I mean like 7 or 8. Some of them I still talk to, but a lot of them I told because they themselves had been assaulted. So early into freshman year I had my first kiss, which led to my first make out session. Of course I freak out because there's this heavy weight on top of me and I hadn't control anything. My heart started to race and I had a hard time breathing. I was having an anxiety attack. That's when I started cutting. All of freshman year I was cutting on and off. Nowhere anyone could see though. The next few months things got better and worse all the time. One week I'd be fine and the next I'd be scared to go home because the person that did that to me would be back there. About February I had my first boyfriend. I told him about it and whenever I would start freaking out when we were doing something he would be totoally okay with it and just make sure I was okay. Truly a great guy. We broke up after about 9 months. I didn't have a lot of trouble with him sexually but when I did it was bad. We never had sex though. To this day I am still a virgin.

Now I'm a sophomore in high school and for the past few months as I've been pleasuring myself and such, I would start crying. It's not like any of the things I was doing to myself he had done to me, but I would constantly think of someone, him, another man, holding me against my will and raping me or forcing me to do things. What happened to me was not anywhere this close to extreme, and sometimes I feel like I just need to get over myself and deal with it because nothing really bad happened. But something did happen, and Sometimes I feel like it was my fault and I was in the wrong and I wasn't abused or anything and it was just kids being kids. But on the other hand I remember him knowing exactly what to do and how to make himself feel good.

I know he took advantage of me. But cutting since fifth grade and being in a constant state of fear of my eighth grade history teacher doesn't add up from what he did. It's not like he forced me to do anything. I've read so many articles, I've contacted Planned Parenthood and RAINN chatrooms asking them if I'd even been abused. They all said that's up for me to decide. Maybe it wasn't the thing that happened to me though. Maybe it was the fact that he would hit my mom my dad and me and that put the fear into my head. I don't know what caused it but I feel like I'm overreacting but I just can't help the anxiety and the tears and the thought of some man inside of me whenever I touch myself. But it just doesn't add up.

I do sometimes wish I was raped. It would make life clearer. It might cause more trauma but at least I would know it wasn't my fault. At least I would know it was assault or I would know it was abuse. at least I would have the courage to tell an adult and not have them judge me thinking that I was just some horny kid who messed around with a family member because I was such a horny child. I would know why I feel so exposed and preyed on. Because right now I have no idea why I feel this sort of... I don't even know if you can call it PTSD.

I know people who have been raped will tell me to never wish this upon myself but I really do. It might make my life harder, but I won't have to question everything I do and think to myself that I'm an attention seeker even when I never told anybody some of this information. If you still feel as though you need to tell me I'm a terrible person, go right ahead. I already feel guilty about this feeling.";1

672;672;1933_ptsd;"Struggling to cope I've had PTSD for around 10 years now. First, it was all from how traumatic everything was when I saw my dad die and then when some things happened with my ex boyfriend. I'm now married and my husband doesn't believe that PTSD is a real thing. My mother in law just thinks I'm being dramatic about all of it. Last night, I had some bad nightmares and this morning, my husband woke me up by grabbing my arm and getting in my face (new anxiety meds put me in a deep sleep). I told him to get off of me and to stop touching me multiple times and he still kept doing it. It triggered everything and just made me freak out. I ran to the bathroom to be alone but he followed me and banged on the bathroom door calling my name which made everything even more worse. When I managed to get out to take some anxiety meds, he still got in my face and would not leave me alone and eventually ended up throwing my phone at me hard and calling his mom to tell her everything. As usual, he response was that I'm being dramatic and overreacting. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the nightmares and my husband and his family not understanding what I'm going through.im tired of constantly being told I'm being dramatic.  I see a psychiatrist for meds and am waiting to see a counselor for therapy. I just feel like giving up and dying sometimes because of all of this. I've calmly talked to my husband about how I feel, but he doesn't seem to care about any of this. I'm just done. ";1

I have PTSD from sexual assault, sexual abuse as a child, and being groomed as a teen. In my first week of university I was spiked and raped. I feel like this is affecting me the most. It’s September, it’s freshers week. I can’t sleep because every time I close my eyes I feel the panic that I felt when I couldn’t get them off me and when I was stumbling around trying to find my clothes. I’ve just had my period, and it reminded me (as it does every month) of how I bled for two weeks afterwards. My only support has gone, he is overwhelmed and needs space. He’s left. I’m lost. I’m struggling at work even though I love my job. I have no friends, in university they all called me a liar. Said it must have just been a drunk one night stand. I don’t know where to go from here.";1

We send my toddler to daycare 4 days a week so I can keep my anxiety levels down and get things done (OCD and I have post partum anxiety that ramps up when I am with her for too many days, so cleaning is important and time alone). Also to keep her safe if I get like this.  

I need/want to do things today and was looking forward to it. I tried drinking coffee and putting the phone away and doing a small task but my body and brain are saying ""nope"". So now it is 2:24 p.m. and I am in bed, pj's still, not a thing done, teeth not brushed even, and my legs are spasming from the conversion disorder while my brain feels like it is being squeezed. However I can think clearly and type (albeit slowly). 

My body wants to go to sleep again but I just slept 11 hours that I didn't want to. I can't figure out a trigger. I track my moods and activities and avoid any and all triggers, yet here I am. It has been 3 years. I am so sick of this. 

Just need to vent. Someone tell me what to do? I cannot get up (well I can but tell my brain that) because my body thinks I have a disease or am paralysed/blind/deaf all because my brain is confusing it. Arrghhh.

Realised that this illness has more subtlety than I realised. I've lived with it for two decades, and have been treated for it for five years. I've learned so much and grown so much but the heavy handed illness has yet to relinquish most of its more subtle, insidious, elements.

I am moving into my own place soon but I can't stop thinking about all the ways it could go wrong. How terrified and weak I feel in having to get assistance. My last semester's marks came back as full honours, yet I can't accept that because in my mind they were not good enough. Subtlety. The dread of failure, the insecurity of not having control. 

At least I have some insight now. Hopefully I can navigate my current struggles with some more clarity.

All noises appear very loud, all my senses were sharpened. I found a silent space and sat down to relax and it helped a little.

I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD.  I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have.  I just want to vent/ramble/rant.  **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)

I had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply.  I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that.  I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find.  I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts.  

I've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them.  I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance.  I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma.  That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing.  

Nope.  A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house.  They got into a mild shouting argument.  Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No.  I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear.  Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything.  I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down.  I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door.  I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin.  The threats.  The sounds of objects being thrown.  The death threats.  The assault.  The screaming.  Wondering if he is really going to kill her.  The crying.  Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again.";0
805;805;1469_ptsd;"Suffering Suffering, Losing My Twin Brother TLDR: Fill your well of sorrow with natural, wholesome joys.

This story is tragic, and I’m omitting personal details for a lot of reasons, but my experience is, in sharing my story, that others have found solace. Last summer, after a family event/argument led to domestic violence at home, I decided to move out of the house, where I was living with my twin brother. He had suffered from depression for most of his life, but towards the end, he became increasingly violent and manic. I was scared, and confused, and did what I thought was best for me and my partner at the time, and moved down the street to a new apt. The next day, after working, and not hearing from him, I started to get a sick feeling in my stomach. I ignored it for a few hours, drinking water and laying down, but the sick feeling grew into something else that I can’t describe. I’m sure you’ve heard stories of twins sensing each other, especially in times of distress. It’s rare, but I’m telling you, that shit is very real. So I walked over to our house, and he didn’t answer the door. It was a Tuesday night. He was 32. We were 32.

My actual experience is something too horrible and sad to describe in detail, but I did find him, and I’m the one who went in, and raised him up, and took him off of that rope. That tangible, physical experience, mixed with the tragedy of losing my twin brother, my best friend, who I spent my entire childhood with, has left me deeply traumatized. There’s an element to it that took part of my identity itself, as a twin, I’m now now longer part of a set. I’m half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How do I continue to be a twin without my match? Is a set still a set, once you apply subtraction? Am I still a twin now that he is gone?

My trauma experience is a nightmare, literally. My dreams manifest things I don’t even want to go into, and I’ve never been so aware of how many times suicide is mentioned in films, television, even comedy. It’s everywhere, and the suicide rates among young people are at unprecedented levels. My triggers induce a deep breath in me, at the mention of the word, or image, or a roped off front yard, Dad attempting to make the grass grow. Or a bread tie. Or a dog collar. It’s weird how things manifest like that. Unfortunately the mystery leaves me vulnerable to crying episodes in public, or leaving social gatherings early, and unannounced. I attempted to continue to suck it up, and be social, but my loss made me nervous, confused, empty. It left me empty. But, like the dry chalice might be considered to be empty, perhaps the purpose of the chalice, is to be filled. And so it flows into me...

It taught me to see truth a little clearer, but this has been hard. Truth requires self reflection first, self truth, whatever that means to you. I had to look hard at myself in order to deal with my grief and my guilt, and I know I’ll struggle to understand these issues for the rest of my life. I’ve been writing and reading about suicide, bipolar disorder (which he had), consciousness, empathy, truth, friendships, spirituality, and sorrow to try to process all of this. 

I never could have imagined being in this place, on this island. At first, many were supportive, but slowly I became more and more isolated, feeling like no one possibly could understand what I was going through. I slowly lost most of the people in my life, not because they didn’t care, but because they didn’t have the capacity to show it, they just didn’t know how. Who could blame them? I was confrontational, angry, sad, confused, and hoping someone was going to make it better for me. But it wasn’t about anyone else, if I was going to ever feel good again, it was going to be ME who made that happen. It’s amazing how everything can turn on a dime, and never return. It’s like, when he died, he took this..  thing... from me. What it is, I can’t name, but it’s gone for sure, and I’m pretty sure it’s not coming back. So what do I do with it, this emptiness? I walk with it. Literally. I walk and walk the trails on this island all day. It’s winter now, so it’s much colder, and my walks are filled with less pauses, but I persist. 

I’m in therapy, sometimes several times a week. I do not consume alcohol or hard drugs. I use particular psychedelics with a therapeutic intent, and have experienced profound revelations that have been helpful in moving my mind in a more conscious and positive direction. I take natural herbal supplements for energy and mood balancing, but I find that exercising in a natural environment is the best thing for me therapeutically. I’m lucky to be young enough to be so mobile. 

I’ve slowly shed all social media, FB, IG, etc, because I found it to contribute to my anxiety, my isolation, and resentment. I was constantly trying to openly share, self examine, and had hopes that others would reciprocate. But people don’t really want to do that. It’s super uncomfortable, and most would rather be distracted by the game, or their phone, or a drink. Finally, after a point in which I felt like what I was saying fell on deaf ears, I decided to no longer share with those who couldn’t hear it anymore. My therapist brought to mind the biblical concept “cast ye your pearls before swine”.  Of course I’m not saying my words are gospel, and in fact, I offer no advice to anyone, this is all purely my experience and expression. 

In fact, I’m in distress a lot, and I’m not saying that any of this made me a “better person”, I’m saying it made me wake the fuck up to myself, and what I was doing. Things don’t get easier, they just get different. Tragedy sometime can birth strength, but often times, tragic events do not make people better, stronger, or more aware, in fact it often makes us more disconnected, more isolated, feeling like we’re unique, and our pain is unique. Victims of trauma can’t be put into order in a filing cabinet, there’s no sense to be made of it. Some are resentful of those thriving, saying “that’s not my experience”. Of course it isn’t. It’s just yours. And this is just mine. And although my situation and personality are unique, I find my pain isn’t. The whole world is suffering suffering. My pain might just disappear, like a drop becomes the ocean, in the great vastness of collective consciousness, if I can release myself of the burden through empathy. Might any of us be strong enough to let the ocean completely envelop us? 

So it’s been a few weeks now since I’ve been free from Instagram and Facebook, and my urge to check a screen, my addiction to check in on these carefully manicured presentations of digital life, has faded. Leaving me again, more room to be filled with the good things I enjoy in life. Playing my guitar, and reading Melville in the bathtub, meditating outside, walking the sandy trails with the rabbits, listening to my favorite records, and most importantly, spending time with my loving and compassionate partner, who is the most selfless, understanding soul in my whole world. Without love, I would have perished along with my brother, but it’s love that kept me alive, and keeps me going. If I can learn to love myself truly, I know I’ll survive. 

I hope to someday find a way to have a PTSD service dog, although it seems unlikely, due to the cost of training one properly (about $20K). I absolutely love dogs, and I think about adopting one frequently, but again, it’s so hard for me to initiate important things, I can’t even imagine starting this process. A good friend of mine has a couple hounds who love me, and make me super happy, so sometimes, when I’m really down, I just go lay on the floor over at his house, and let the dogs go to town licking me and climbing all over me. It’s so sensational and wonderful, I smile just writing about it. A pure, simple, wholesome joy. 

I’m not past the pain, I’m just finding out better ways in which to navigate it. Some days, the seas are choppy, but at least the sails are full. The shores of the seas of my mental landscape, are lined by a great, “mental forest”. My twin brother was a great tree in my forest, and hard he fell, but that break in the canopy has given my forest new growth. Exotic species sprout from the sunlit patch spontaneously, and they invite me in, and we become one, and I enjoy the sun with them while I can. 

Are you in pain? I already love you.";1

On Jan. 30, 2018 I became a survivor of murder-suicide.

Facts were written in the media, case files, autopsy reports and death certificates. They were illustrated with crime scene photos and national news headlines.

Breadcrumbs of truth built the narrative for me, never telling the full story.

There are 11 murder-suicides each week in the United States, often in military and veteran communities. Why aren’t we talking about this publicly beyond sensationalized headlines that don’t help solve the problem?

The lack of support, information, and humanization led me to believe nobody *should* be talking about it. I felt voiceless and carried significant guilt and shame because of the stigmatized circumstances.

I’m taking back the narrative. As a survivor of murder-suicide, I am more than a murderer’s daughter.

My writing will add to the national conversation on mental health and veteran post-traumatic stress disorder. I hope my story will educate the public and help survivors of this type of tragedy to know they are not alone; the shame is not theirs to carry as they navigate their complex journey.

If you are a survivor of murder-suicide, or know somebody who is looking for support, please consider following my blog here: [www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com](https://www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com). I am connecting with researchers and fellow survivors to reduce the stigma on this awful experience, and help other survivors. I am committed to taking my experience and turning it into a force for good to help others.

When I was 12, I was groomed and molested by my Grandfather. Admittedly this is really hard for me to write down as I've yet to really accept and work through what has happened. Even if it's been 6 years. 

2 months ago I was watching a Video about psychology (as I do almost everyday) and the topic was about the Sexual abuse that can occur with children without them realising that what's happening is wrong and scarring. That hit the nail in the coffin and the realisation hit me like a train. I wanted to throw up, curl in a ball and scream, and cry.... After 2 months of torture on my part I finally told my mum. While this happened my grandfather(abuser) frequently visits and calls almost everyday. I get panic attacks everytime it's brought up or if I'm reminded of it in some way... The guilt and shame is killing me. So it's really hard for me to express and talk about my feeling about my... Situation

I can't take it anymore. I can't stand to even think about that pedophile let alone be in the same room as him. So I've cut off ties, not answering the phone or hiding etc. My grandmother started meddling (It's typical behaviour for that part of the family) and won't stop asking questions no matter how much I tell her to leave it. So she started asking my dad questions and he doesn't take well to them. 

So this brings me to my current dilemma. I don't know if I should tell my father and/or How I should tell him. I'm stuck in a corner and this could destroy my family. I don't even know if they'll believe me or not! My family sort of despise me because I'm Granddaddy's favourite (ain't that ironic?) 

Mum really helps a lot but she's not always there to help me out of the situations. So I'm turning to you for advice, Reddit. 

Please, any advice on this would be greatly appreciate. I know this might not be the best subreddit to ask this but.... You're my only hope now.";1
1114;1114;2333_ptsd;"Terrified of what a therapist would say to me about this all I'll leave this as a trigger warning for a few things




To keep this part quick and simple, my family life is terrible and quite terrifying, to say the least, and I'm sure this has played a very large part, but that's not quite what I'm wanting to bring up.
I don't want to call this PTSD, no, definitely not.
I feel as though this can never be on that ""level"" I suppose, in a way.
I know things like this can't be on a scale, but that's just what it feels like.
I feel like if I were to go to a therapist, I'll have my fears that this all was just me overreacting, confirmed, which isn't a bad thing you know, but just for this, I just don't know how I would react.
I'd probably feel dreadful for wasting their time, for one. 
All of this panicking and crap for what's deemed as something so small.
I don't want to call this abuse, or toxic. I can't do that because it doesn't feel like that, speaking from an emotional standpoint.
I guess I'll just say it was really bad.
Not so long ago, I broke up with a girl who i guess you could say wasn't the best.
She kind of treated me like crap, made me feel like everything was my fault.
Even looking back and knowing it wasn't, a part of me feels so guilty for something I know wasn't my doing[yet it still feels so].
She disregarded my feelings, then up and left for about three months, putting quite a bit in front of me, which I could understand at first.
You can't put everything on hold for one person, and I could understand that even at 13-14.(ive just turned 16 a few months ago)
It was online, so it's not like she could've drove near me and do anything, but that really didn't make me any less terrified everytime I saw messages of her being blatantly angry with me, being upset with soemthing I might've done wrong or said.
We never called much, which I suppose I'm thankful for, but the times we did, I guess it was okay.
I guess I was terrified of what my parents would think, given they weren't (still kind of aren't) the most supportive.
My father was upset when I came out, being that he couldn't quite accept that I'm gay.
She led me on though, and for a while.
She was really upset when I wouldn't just accept her confession and that she wanted to go out, so i guess I kind of forced myself to liking her just a bit.
It all kind of felt rushed, but I was truly in love with her, despite the fact that others would probably say it was just puppy love(I imagine for good reason).
She kind of made me think my friends were the bad ones, like she was in the right.
I gave her three chances, and I accepted her with no hesitation for every one of those.
I have flashbacks almost every day, I'm kind of terrified to do much or go anywhere near that reminds me of her.
I can't even say her name without breaking down.
I've had at least three panic attacks, one being in school to which the teacher had to escort me out and I had to go home.
This may be a bit disorganised, and I'm really sorry about that, but my brain is a bit jumbled and I guess this isn't the easiest to think and talk about.
This wouldn't be so hard if I didn't hear her, if I didn't see her in my head everytime.
The flashbacks aren't just flashbacks to me you know, they literally drag me in to a point at which I'm choking and trying to get out.
I tend to panic and not get ""out"" of it for a while, and I more often than not, dissociate from my body in a way so it seems.
I would go into depth a bit more, but I've been told that's what I do whenever I panic that way by an old therapist.
The memories aren't really in order, and I don't think I can remember specific things because they're going so fast, maybe?...
I don't think fast is the right word, but they're kind of just thrown at me all at once.
I can phsycially feel her, hear her sometimes, and being shizoafective doesn't help at all.
I'm so utterly frustrated at the fact that I'm unable to let go, but I don't think my family would deem it ""normal"" for me to say that there are memories holding me down or anything like that.
They wouldn't really understand, unfortunately.
I haven't told anyone about this but a friend who has been here from beginning to now with this whole ordeal, given my family's reaction won't be anywhere near supportive.
I'm going to a placement centre sometime soon, but I don't know when.
I'm terrified that I'm just overreacting, you know.
I'm terrified that a part of me just ""wants"" this in a way, like I deserve this.
Again, I really apologise for the mess, I'm not the most organised when it comes to my emotions and such.
She told me she was sorry and it was heavily implied that she, at the very least, attempted suicide.
How am I supposed to handle that?..
Everytime I think about it, I just think about the fact that this is just
It's nothing compared to something else so much worse.
She could've been here, you know?..
Phsycially been here, but she wasn't.
I know comparing isn't a thing of suggestion with something like this, but I have such a habit and compulsion to do exactly that.
I feel as though my problems and this is nothing whatsoever.
I feel pathetic for even being so distraught over it.
I'll probably delete this because I wouldn't want anyone finding this and making connections, if anyone I know happen to find this.
I really apologise for this though, I hope I'm not taking up anyone's important time.";1

due to this trauma, anytime i see the aforementioned honda fit, i go into a complete panic attack mode. it’s like whenever he passed they’re all of a sudden there. constantly. wherever i go, they’re there too. and i need help coping with this.

962;962;2599_ptsd;"The moment that changed me and my thought process for the rest of my life Stay in my room until work, either sleeping the whole time or manic af from lack of sleep and minimal drug use. Not good i know but i have to start being honest at least w myself. 
I found this year that i enjoy dulling down my reality instead of facing problems. 

 Drugs make me feel something, while dulling down the pain
I don't want to escape as much as i want to numb my thoughts from hurting myself. When my thoughts become verbal my moods lash out on others and it makes me hate my existence that much more. 
Which triggers a wave of suicidal thoughts, self doubt, and a can't do attitude. 
I just give up
I am sick and tired of holding the weight of these ideations within the thin barriers of my skull, im growing old and tierd.
When it started, i thought i brought these thoughts into my head, and i would feel shame for it. For why am i doing this to myself?
6 years later its gotten progressively worse, i quit drinking and began a regaulr pill regimen  (also smoking marajuana) to keep myself balanced, or calm. I was less on edge, found a bit of happiness within myself and my creative side and began to feel human again. 
Now the flip side to that is the rap sheet of side effects that come along with these pills.
Stabalize your mind, sacrifice your body.
It's taking a chance everytime, adverse reactions and misdiagnosis over those 6 years didn't help. By the timei was aged 25 i had been on or around 25 different pills and different combinations within of those pills. 
By the end of my 6 years medication tweaking process, and 3 misdiagnosis, 6 hospitalizations, and pretty much a team of specialists, and a dozen doctors,  along w a cat scan of my brain in 2014.
It took hell of a toll on my body, and brain functions. My liver an kidneys wont last forever..
The runaround, a serious uphill battle im still pushing through..learning a lot about my mind and mostly thought process.
Why am i so mean to myself? 

 and as of today my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder bi polar type, i struggle with anxiety (mostly social) and frequent panic attacks (which can be triggered by the way someone i know looks me wrong) me being called sensitive would be a huge understatement. Around the time of my first hospitalization in 2009 i witnessed my friend and roommate at the time get beat within an inch from his life with brass knuckles to the face. 
I remember nothing past the porch where he laid still, getting beat on our own front lawn repeatedly. 
My mind permanently blocked that from me.Next time i have a memory from that moment im looking over him-- laying in the blood soaked grass, in total shock. His face was a blood puddle, in panic mode i went and scooped him from his back to his feet. At that second i embraced his tall frail figure as his wounds dripped down onto my suicidal tendencies shirt (oh the irony)  my arms wrapped all the way around his body, for i just wanted him to feel safty or comfort. Grabbing him by the hand i guidedus to a safer space indoors.
Around me was a blur, friends and neighbors scolded me, for ""he could have a neck or back injury! Leave him laying!"" 
I was not only in shock, but also processing a violent and traumatic event that changed my life forever. 
I was scared, he was petrified. 
I told all the neighbors and by standers basically to fuck off and
As for my friend- now gushing blood from his cuts, eye sockets, mouth and nose. 
just like a skipping cd in your old walkman, he was stuck in a constant shuddering loop fearing for his life. 
""They're going to come back and kill me""
Over and over and over and over..
Once into our house i lead him into the bathroom, swiftly locking the door behind.
""Call 911, they're going to come back and kill me"" again and again as he ran water over his face, pressing his broken bone structure completely flat, blood pouring from all parts of his kind and beautiful face. 
He couldn't feel it, he could barely process what had happened, for it happened so fast. 
I watched him try to
Rinse all the blood away only more would streamout.&amp;Panic struck, the ambulance was now on its way but inwas starting to expierence by first delusion. 
After that summer i didn't see my friend again until 10 years later. 
What i said to him was, i have been through so much since then that stemmed from that dark moment in our past, struggled with literal demons inside my head, woken up to images of corpses laying in my bed. 
But i will never know how you managed to stay so strong, so beautiful, and so kind even after something so awful could happen. 
I have no idea how he did it i said, how he pulled through and came out on top.
Dude, he could have been beat to death if someone hadn't stepped in. 

One of the moments that shaped me, made me grow and helped me learn so much about myself id never had gotten the chance to if our paths may not have crossed. 
Cos i usually think ""man, i wonder what life would've became if these blips in time hadn't happened at all?""
Maybe id have some sort of success, or maybe just no chronic disorder that effects almost every aspect of my life in some sort of way. Im unsure, always wonder, then feel weak minded.
Soon after we went through this i found myself laying on my bare bed, last nights last breath escapingaway as the mourning sun crept through the crack in the window where the card board had shifted.
I stayed home all alone with my thoughts that night. 
Not knowing how many sleepless nights, and waking nightmares mixed with violent hallucinations id have ahead of me. 
The mind is a very fragile thing, science knows little about mental illness as it is-so to see me, 4 or 5 days later after that night, days became weeks then into one bad blurred summer.
To explain it all in full detail wouldn't make any sense whatsoever -but i basically looked like your local circle k crack head on no sleep talking to the air. 
Sad thing is, mental illness and drug addiction look a whole lot alike. 
Your brain looses one to many days of sleep then all the sudden i think im related to  Egyptian gods, and my brother is a cannabal living on an ancient Indian burial ground, and theres a government drone disguised as a house fly watching me.
The house was alive, and teeth snapped my feet at every step.
The windows were breathing. I sawa glimpse of a body on the stain in the laundry room, had conversations with hairless rats and sat in a chair crafted from hitlers bones.
I could feel the chill air pass, i felt negative spirits, saw shadow people while christmas carolers sang outside my door.
None of this was real, this was just a snipit of the things i've seen and heard but told they weren't really there. 
I was awake, yet dreaming in gruesome splashes and disorganized thoughts. 
I was alive to exist. 
I felt pain all over.
Once admited i was so unrulyi wasn't able to be near any other patients at least half a day to a day. I spent that time in the yellow hallway in the nude and a pair of flats, pissing on myself while flooding my room. 
When they brought my food, i ripped my name badge from the tray. I ate my name for dinner, refused the meal, kicking it across the hallway.
Water began to trickle out of my room, and by the time they asked me to get dressed they saw..
I shoved all the sheets, blankets and my clothes into the toilet, and sink only to keep them running and flushing til someone decided to check on my crazy naked ass.
I just didnt want to be alone.
So i made sure they had to keep me close, and segregating an unstable lil girl who wants to die and has no clue what reality is anymore is inhumane. 
I spent the next 3 weeks there making no damn sence, i was completely detached from reality coloring with crayons, banging my head inbetween the door way and the wall. 
It hurt everywhere in a different way, but they couldnt make it stop so i would hurt myself. 
I hadn't showered in over a week, 2 nurses insisted on helping me bathe. 
Once in the water all i could do was scream, cry and fight them.
I was 20.
Life hit different for me young, and life got in the way of a lot of things but it humbled m

961;961;2469_ptsd;"The Only Way Out is Through: Using Virtual Reality for PTSD in Veterans  In 1997, virtual reality, then a newly developed technology, was hypothesized to be an effective method of delivering exposure therapy. In virtual reality exposure therapy, the person is immersed in a computer-created virtual environment. While initially developed for advanced game play, it was quickly realized that the technology could also be used therapeutically.  The first study with ten veterans demonstrated that this therapy was effective in symptom improvement in all participants. This success was considered so significant that after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York’s World Trade Center, burn victims suffering from PTSD were treated using virtual reality exposure techniques. The outcomes for this treatment situation was also extremely successful. 

To date, virtual reality exposure therapy for PTSD has primarily been used with Vietnam War veterans so the virtual setting includes such imagery as helicopters and jungles. Research has shown that this type of therapy helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in these veterans. A few subsequent studies conducted with small numbers of Iraq and Afghanistan War vets found that virtual reality based therapy was also helpful in reducing symptoms in these former soldiers. 

[This article](https://medium.com/swlh/the-only-way-out-is-through-using-virtual-reality-for-ptsd-in-veterans-a0a3a0b1b3db?source=friends_link&amp;sk=67afc5dbc04e6a71afec35e744d68eb1) discussed an amazing personal experience working on an inpatient PTSD unit at the VA Hospital in New Orleans.  A more complete discussion of virtual reality exposure therapy is also presented.

I know that sounds so cruel but I don’t get why they are living to the fullest when they are the ones who deserve to be in my position. Makes me feel down to the point I don’t want to live anymore.

346;346;889_ptsd;Therapies - content/trigger warning Hi, new reddit member.. I am looking for advice on therapies that have worked for you. My counselor told me to research EMDR, CBT, DBT, exposure and narrative therapies (also open to hearing about others). What have you found helpful? For context, my PTSD stems mostly from having been kidnapped and raped at 14. Thanks in advance;0
1084;1084;1707_ptsd;"Therapist Delaying PE This is going to be part rant/venting, part advice. I know it's long winded so I understand if people don't manage to get through it. Today was the first time I put this in words and finally explained it to my wife and now I don't know where to go from here.

So, I'm currently in therapy for PTSD as well as other things. Over the last year I've worked through DBT skills group to help me learn new coping skills in preparation for PE. But now that I've completed group and it's time to start PE my therapist thinks I'm not ready. She doesn't think that I've stopped blaming myself and that PE right now will only make things worse for me. I don't know what to do with that information because I don't know how to stop blaming myself.

A little background, I'll put as much as my brain will let me. Seven years ago my only child passed away. His death was in part due to hospital error. I know you're probably thinking ""That sounds like the hospital's fault not yours."" but hear me out. There was a sequence of events that lead to his death, and in this sequence of events there were times I could have done something and didn't. I made several conscious decisions as things unfolded. I saw with my own eyes that the hospital wasn't following protocol. I knew this because they had already explained the protocol and we had to sign releases giving them permission explicitly for this particular treatment. I knew this. But when I saw them breaking that protocol I was too damned scared to say anything. I was too much of a coward to face my fear of confronting the staff to say anything and I __chose__ to stay quiet. Later, I had a second opportunity to speak up and I again chose not to. Then, when things had progressed too far, they believed his heart was beginning to fail and asked us if they should resuscitate, but that it might not do any good. My wife was too scared to answer so __I made the decision to let him go__. I made the decision to let my own child die.

I feel like the hospital metaphorically put a loaded gun to my child's head and I saw it happening and did absolutely nothing to stop it. I may not have pulled the trigger but I saw what was happening and my own cowardice stopped me from doing anything.

How do I not blame myself for this? How do I let go of feeling like I played a part in this when I made actual conscious decisions that lead up to my own child's death? I'm being told that PE is my best hope and chance of getting better but that I can't do it until I'm ready to stop blaming myself. But I have no fucking clue how to do that. So this is where the advice comes in. How have you guys gotten over feeling like it's your fault? What did you do to get you over that hump so you could start healing?

Thanks in advance for reading and any replies with help/advice you guys have.";1
405;405;270_ptsd;"Therapist hesitant about diagnosing me with PTSD because of other doctor claiming I have post concussion syndrome after car accidents. This is my first post ever and because i’ve been a long time lurker I’ve decided to ask for your guys advise because of the great support Reddit gives each other. English is not my first language so bare with me please..

A little bit of background story. Started grown up job which consited of driving a lot. Had 2 car accidents in a short period of time. After the second one I couldnt take anything anymore and felt like I was having a mental meltdown. Worked since i was 14 and couldnt lift a finger after the accident. Felt like I was losing my mind literally. 

Couldnt talk to people normally without crying and wasnt myself anymore. Childhood things arose during therapy sessions like arguing of my parents and molestations from family member. I thought that I outgrew everything but after the accidents I cant live my normal life without thinking about the past, crying and feeling worthless. My love for people and life dissapeard as if was never there and was feeling quite suicidal without wanting to be actually dead for a long while.

Was going to therapy since the beginning. Therapist was thinking about PTSD but after telling her that my normal doctor suspected me from having post concussion syndrome (because of the forgetfulness, headaches dizziness etc) she is waiting for other test i guess to conclude that it really is ptsd.

Im really hopeless and want to do just anything to get better. So my question is can anyone relate to this or what do you advise me to tell my therapist because I really wanted to start EMDR and I feel as if it is going to take forever..

But as soon as I'm confronted with my ""issues"" I fall into this deep dark pit again and need a several days to recover. 

I'm toying with the thought of ending therapy or maybe just taking a break at this point, because I have discovered so many other ways to make me feel better which I can't do when therapy drains my energy that much.

I want therapy. I want to heal and become a whole human being. I want to work through my traumas, remember it, reconcile it, and move on. I want to be able to trust people who deserve it, and walk away from people who deserve that without feeling guilty. I want to be the best version of my self so I can raise my son's to be healthy human beings. 

I want to be able to like myself. I want to feel like I deserve things. 

My problems, and their dads, have affected them and I want to help them heal to.  I can't fix the past but I can give them a emotionally healthy and stable ready of their childhood. 

So I need therapy.  Probably specific therapy. I don't know how to really go about it. I've tried it before but it's been nothing profound and I have a hard time taking these people's time as if my experiences are as horrific as others who need help more. I tell whiney, complainey, undeserving of telling my story and it holds me back. 

I need to be able to unpack my trauma. I need to.  Then I need to work through the emotions. The abandonment, fear, shame, unworthiness. Then I need to put it to bed healthily. Then I need to work with someone to difficult or how I feel about my abusers and what I should do next.

I was ordered my the court to receive mental health treatment. I bounced around from therapist to therapist until I found one who cared about me. I opened up and can say that I have begun healing. I spent 20+ years in turmoil never realizing that PTSD was affecting me in so many ways. It always will affect me but now I have the power to understand it and work through it.

Also, I wanted to point out that what I'm talking about is obviously just a small part of the process of getting back on your feet, but still it felt essential to me. Everyone's experience is different and this is just my personal perspective. 

Sorry for my broken English, I hope this can be helpful to someone. 

I guess I have improved a lot in the last year. 
I really don't want to go back to the hole of despair I was trapped in, but sometimes I get scared I might let myself slip off into it again.

To prevent that, I make sure to bury any thoughts about my past very deep as soon as I sense them arise, of course some of them manage to sneak out and they get back at me in spades.

I still get glimpses of moments I had successfully forgotten about. 
It makes me feel like I'm still there, but it happens less and less frequently and every time it gets easier to snap back. 

Up until a year ago, I was leading a life that was split in half between the present and the past. 
The present seemed to be so dull, as if I were half-asleep, while the past felt so much more real and threatening.

I used to be so angry, I don't know how else to describe it other than it felt like fire was running through my veins. It was the only thing I felt and I couldn't help but cling to it, since it seemed to be my life's sole purpose and sustenance.
 
I kept reliving the events of my trauma, going through them in my head over and over again. Each time getting angrier and angrier. 
I didn't mind it at all, I was actually glad for this blind rage. As if it fueled me. 

**START OF TRIGGER WARNING**

I had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. 

**END OF TRIGGER WARNING**

After I escaped, ordinary life was simply idle.
Hadn't it been for this anger, I would have just gone numb.

Although comforting, I came to realize that I would have never been able to move forward without letting go of it all, the anger, the constant replay of gruesome scenes in my mind, the pointless questions that would never find any answers.

Things were also getting out of hand, to the point where I involuntarily broke my friend's arm as I was startled by her giving me a hug unexpectedly. 
I was horrified at what I had done. 
I'm a petite girl but I've been fighting professionally for a long time and I couldn't bear the thought of harming someone whose only fault was getting caught between my messed up brain and me. 

It's a hard process to forget about the abuse I had been through as a child and then again as an adult, but I'm managing and it does get easier. 
I had never thought it to be true, but time really does heal all wounds.

But most importantly it's the people you love. Keep them close. Even if you feel the need to cut everybody off and confine yourself in your pain, don't. Don't let this trauma induced sentiment prevail.
It's not what you or your loved ones need. 
The ones we care about are the only thing that keeps us grounded to reality, to the present. 
You can take small steps, there's no rush, you don't have to let everyone in on everything you are feeling unless you want to. Just try, as difficult as it is, to be open to their affection. 

Being passionate about something is hard after you have survived trauma and readjusting to everyday life is particularly disorienting when you don't have a purpose, you just feel hollow. A good place to start is making it a point to be able to take care of the people you love. Having to be someone your dear ones can rely on, eventually makes you get back on track and you are going to become even stronger than you were before. 

It's ironic how being a survivor makes you feel so dead inside, it might feel like you have lost all control over your own body and mind. 
But please know this kind of feelings are only temporary. You have gone through a nightmare and made it out alive. You will overcome these feelings as well. 
 
You won't have to look back at the person you were before in sorrow, you are growing to become someone you will learn to love. 
You will have suffered greatly and still been able to pull yourself back up, you can accomplish anything you put your mind to. 

Life only gets better and better from here, it's tough but so are you.";1

It threw me off for the rest of my test... this feels like such a set back. I had to abandon my career associated with my undergrad degree after being blackballed from the industry by a scheming boss lady and the pond scum of a coworker who assaulted me and mentally and emotionally messed with me. After a year of suffering anxiety, depression, flash backs, nightmares, and various SN responses to certain places, people, thoughts, I’ve had the chance to process and work through via therapy and journaling. 

I made my decision to pursue a law degree that I was on the fence about. The LSAT is ranked out of 180 points with a 165 being high enough to get you in to most schools. The first LSAT practice exam I took I scored a 152. This last one, I hit a question that stated in quotations something that was said to me upon my termination, and I dove deep into memory lane. My mind started racing and I felt flighty and nervous all of a sudden and started rushing through the test just wanting to escape. I didn’t complete that section and did horrendous on what should’ve been my best session. I only got a 142. 

Of course these are just practice exams and not the end all be all; however, my GPA is not too great considering I spent most of my final semester coping... I need that high score to get in to law school. 

I’m so scared that something like this will happen on the actual test day next month. I’ve never been set off by something so small before and thought I was doing significantly better- even my therapist has increased the time between our sessions. I’m mad at myself because this is still getting to me. I don’t want them to have control over me any longer and I sure as heck do not want this to put another career in jeopardy for me. 

I never want another intrusive thought. I just want to process and move on.";0

764;764;2092_ptsd;"Those of you with sexual trauma who are unable to have casual sex, how do you stay connected to your sexuality/accept that?  I'm just really, really struggling at the moment with how fraught my relationship with sex is due to trauma. It's near impossible for me to feel safe &amp; connected during sexual situations or at this point, even just thinking about sex.

Realistically it seems that the only way I will be able to gradually build a healthy sexual relationship in which I have the capacity to feel safe, connected &amp; embodied will be within the context of building an emotionally close romantic partnership with someone I feel strong romantic feeling for, am (at least at times) very attracted to, connect with well, and who is happy to understand my trauma and take things very slow.

But that sort of relationship is hard to find and build (especially having lots of attachment issues), and I feel so much sadness, fear &amp; frustration around the fact that I don't seem able to explore my sexuality outside of that context because attempting to do so is triggering 90% of the time. I feel so out of touch with my sexuality and I just don't know how to a) accept that this is where I am, and b) navigate this.

Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice?

Tl;dr: When I was 17 I was forced to abort a baby that I wanted to keep by my parents and ex-boyfriend. It’s ruined my sex life and potential romantic relationships 

It should be noted that I’m not pro life. Pro choice all the way, but I knew those people would support me. 

Since this happened to me, I can’t masturbate. I can feel dick and I can feel it when a guy eats me out, but when it comes to my own fingers, my vagina closes up and refuses to let it in. I get scared of the sound of the vibrator because it reminds me of my procedure. Has anyone had a similar experience or know someone who has? Thanks

205;205;526_ptsd;"Today Does anyone else with ptsd struggle on their birthday really hard. 

I haven’t enjoyed this day for years. A lot of bad things have happened on this day of the year from my mom beating me to threatening hospitalization to needing to run away to getting dumped mental breakdowns. To the point that every year I dread my birthday. Today I’m 19

School has been over for some weeks so I’m spending today as I have every day sitting around the house doing absolutely nothing except crying a little more and being more depressed. And that makes me sad. The day is over soon and I can’t enjoy it

My parents tell me all year I’m a bad kid and don’t deserve anything and they buy things for me then use them against me to guilt trip me. Whenever they’ve bought me huge gifts on my birthday I’ve had a panic attack and then they get angry with me for not wanting to accept them. 

I get depressed and feel guilt when people express excitement. I get depressed and guilty when people buy me gifts, or praise or compliment me, or ask what I want so I tell them I want nothing. 

But I do want to enjoy it. I just can’t make myself. I do want gifts and to feel appreciated but the guilt overwhelms me. I get so upset when people compliment me or do anything. So it’s just better if I’m alone. It’s just better if I get nothing. Then I mourn how the day was miserable and I can’t enjoy it and dread it for the next year. 

Like it’s a cycle I can’t break out of that I want to but I just can’t. It probably doesn’t make sense to anyone.  My friends offered to hang out with me but I’ve just been by myself. Today reminds me of all the ways I’ve done wrong in my life and how I’m not good enough and failing in so many ways . My parents offered to take me out to dinner but I don’t want to go out because I’m so depressed and disgusted by my appearance  . I’m so sad

It was when I got diagnosed with PTSD. I wanted to go back. I really really did. But it was very expensive. I couldn't go.

Last week my family friend (my mom's best friend - she and I are super close) sent me a link to a foundation that offers free therapy to certain people for free in honour of a man who died. It's very new.

I applied not thinking much of it. And I forgot about it.

Then I got an email while I was at work this afternoon saying they want to help me!!! I'm thrilled. My boss walked in and I had a huge smile on my face and all. He was like ""everything good?""

398;398;1155_ptsd;"Took me like 12 years to figure out I have PTSD. It feels as though I’m suffocating underneath an avalanche. [nsfw] Marked as NSFW as it might be triggering to those who dealt with abusive households. 

In December, I decided to spontaneously cease contact with my dad when an opportunity arose. I had been ruminating over that thought for years. I thought I would be free of his emotional abuse, the feeling of being suffocated and having to answer to him. To my surprise, it got really bad. I began to dwell more on the past, and my mom was continuously making me feel guilty, claiming to not understand what could’ve possibly went wrong. This was exhausting to go through. I developed a severe marijuana addiction as a result of being unable to cope with those emotions. I was seeing a psychiatrist but they were ignorant to trauma. 

Last year, I witnessed the van attack in Toronto and it’s aftermath as I walked past Yonge street that day after work, bodies still laid down at 9 pm as the investigation wasn’t complete. This shook my sense of safety as well. I didn’t realize until my first appointment last week with a trauma specialist that it deeply disturbed me and made me incredibly uncomfortable in public. 

I’m almost done, I swear. 

Now I’m realizing how my mom was potentially worse than my dad in some regards. Some of the things she said to me when I decided to cut contact are now things that have made me want to stop contact with her. “I chose you my whole life over him and I suffered for it.” Not really something I wanted to hear, something she likely thinks I’ve forgotten. The more I think back, the more disturbed I get. I feel shackled to this fucked up family situation. The reason I haven’t gone entirely nuclear on my mom is because my younger sibling is still at home and it’s already been a difficult time since I ceased contact with my dad. My moms not making the house a very pleasant place (I moved out a while ago)

If you’ve read this far, I appreciate you so much. Present day, I feel like my chest is full of dread and I feel so heavy. My personal hygiene is a joke, and I’m riddled with intrusive thoughts about harming myself that I can’t listen to because my partner will notice. I feel like I’ve been robbed of a shot at life and I’m so angry for it. I feel like I can’t breathe. I’ve asked to see the therapist on a weekly basis because I’ve never felt so bad. I thought in my twenties I was making progress on my mental health and this all creeped up on me out of nowhere. I was well aware of my situation but it never felt so... life altering. I’m more and more aware of how I’ve been robbed of a childhood, robbed of a sense of safety, robbed from a life free of anxiety and depression. I’m so bitter and angry and I just want to scream. This past week has been a literal hell for me and I don’t know how to get by until my appointment. 

I’m not a danger to myself I just don’t know how to cope. I’ve done so many therapies, I have all the tools. It just all feels meaningless when my situation will never really change. I hate my life.";1
1183;1183;2270_ptsd;"Torn About College Hi everyone! I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that ""traditional college experience."" Truth is, I really hate it. I was diagnosed with PTSD at the end of 2018, alongside depression and anxiety. My trauma happened in February of 2018, so it is pretty fresh and still hurts. It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. 

My other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the ""Traditional college experience"" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week. It might be a long shot that anyone has experience with this. Regardless, can anyone give me some help/advice/reassurance? I'm not sure what to do.

906;906;2664_ptsd;"Touching weirdness (cross-posted from r/OCD)

So touching is a big part of my OCD/PTSD/own special brand of weirdness. I cannot stand and get really uncomfortable when people touch me in most capacities. However, I grew up with the habit of touching others (on the shoulder, arm, face, etc.) as a way to get my point across because I have trouble talking, especially when discussing emotional things.

I understand that it's not okay to touch people without permission and I understand that it can greatly upset some people, because it greatly upsets me. The hypocrisy in my own brain is weird. I feel badly about it because obviously if it upsets me to be touched, I should give other people the same respect and not touch them. But it's really hard to get out of the habit of touching other people.

I really want to work on this, do you guys have any advice?";0

741;741;1715_ptsd;"Trauma &amp; Guilt - a letter to his new wife You. You, what can I say to you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry this is happening to you. I’m so sorry if you’re happy, and I’m sorry if you’re excited for the future. I’m sorry if you’re so comfortable with who you share your life with, I’m sorry I allowed that. I’ve been carrying guilt for years that I granted him the freedom to do this to another individual, and that I was so scared to open up about what occurred four years ago. 

You’re going to find out soon, and you’re not going to believe it at first. You’re going to be told bluntly, and you will reject it. Perhaps you’ve already been told, by his friends that are no longer his friends for a reason that you should know by now. I couldn’t comprehend it either, not at first. I didn’t understand what information I had just been handed, what it meant and what it was doing to me. Four years later I am still processing what it was and who he is. It still weighs on me as heavy as it did that night, but in a different way.

I mourned my relationship first, I had succumbed to what I thought was love, but was ultimately masterful manipulation. He made it easy to attach myself to him with promises of an appealing future. He had a way of convincing me he was smarter than me, and everyone else. You’ll be okay if you stick with me, the rest of the world is toxic and confused. We’re okay if we just stay here. I love you because you’re practical, you’re not like any other girl I’ve dated. They’re all crazy, you’re sane. You’re grounded, and you pay half of the rent. 

He was secretive to start, a few early discrepancies regarding other girls online. Inexperienced me deemed this normal, we could moved passed all of that noise - what counted was where we ended up each night. He kept nude images of these girls on his phone, we were not off to a great start. But I was practical, I was different, and I made him feel smart. I existed to embellish him, an important role - and he knew it. I was his type; insecure and accustomed to abuse. This particular trauma, however, is not abuse. Though there was plenty, emotional and physical abuse. I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it. He shoved me into a wall when I announced his lack of masculinity too loudly. 

He worked in security at a ballet school, often overnight. Based on the mistrust that was instilled in me early on in our relationship, the overnight work worried me. Is he talking to girls? Is he sending them unsolicited dick pics? Probably. By this point he had convinced me it was in my head, and I was massively paranoid. I was turning into one of the girls he didn’t want to be around, someone insane and impractical. But I paid rent, and contributed towards the idea of a future. I was being molded into someone who would love him no matter what doubts I had. 

He had some performance issues come up at his job. I can’t remember what they were regarding, or if they were even real…But he lost his full time position. He maintained employment with the same company at a different location, part-time. We got by with savings and my serving job. I got a call one day from his manager, Patrick. They had originally tried to call him, and I was listed as his emergency contact. It was not the first time I had received a call from his work, so I didn’t think much of it. I was at work when he called so he left a voicemail - I listened to it on my way home from work. He spoke as if he were talking to him, instructing him to call him back - and that they had to cut into all of the lockers at his previous workplace. He listed off a few of the items found in the lockers and wanted to be sure that they were his, and make sure everything was accounted for. There was a laptop, and a safe box. 

I asked him about these items but he assured me they weren’t his. I let it go, as I had many things during our time together. He was picking up a few evening shifts where he could at this time, quite sporadically. He would leave around 2 or 4, and return around 10pm. I got cut from work when the dinner shift showed up, around 4:30. I left work, walked south on Bay Street, east on College, and hopped on the northbound train. I got home around 5:15pm. I unloaded, changed into sweats, the usual. Cleaning was pretty relaxing after a day in the service industry, so I went to grab some supplies under the kitchen sink cupboard. Our kitchen counters were L shaped, and I always thought it was weird that where the space under the cupboard should have ended, it extended passed where the wall above sat. This particular evening I noticed that this was not the case, and somehow the wall had moved forward. I was frightened, I was one of those people that ready creepy stories at night - you know the one where people discover there are people living in small spaces in their home. 

It wasn’t the wall, it was a piece of bristol board. It was relieving for a brief moment - but that relief was short lived. I removed that board and discovered a safe and a laptop. Since that moment I’ve really repressed what I found - through denial or embarrassment, I’ve somehow forgotten in detail what it was I had seen. I still don’t know what journey I set out to after that moment, but it wasn’t to deal with seeing those images. That was my second mistake. My first was my initial thought - the end of my four year relationship. Logic was not present, logic would have been to immediately call the police - instead of waiting for him to come home to confront him about it.* 

If he somehow sees this - he will frantically come up with something to tell you to convince you I am just some crazy ex-girlfriend out to get me for breaking up with me. Or perhaps he has already set something in place to manipulate you into believing that none of this is truth, and anything anyone ever says apart from him is a lie. When I left Toronto, he covered his tracks - and somehow convinced his family and our mutual friends that I was not to be trusted. He was fine, and merely unhappy in our relationship. He never got the help he claimed to seek, he paused his search for child pornography, but not for long. It’s never for very long. Damaged people don’t get better without proper treatment. 

I think about this every fucking day. It’s with me, for better or for worse. I think about the children who attended and lived at the ballet school that he worked at - it’s such a privilege for them to be there, a dream. I think about the children that were trafficked and exploited - contributing to his sick obsession. I think about the women who are trafficked in Southern Ontario. I think about his other ex-girlfriend who also knew about this. I think about his family who are under his false influence. But most of all, I think of you.

785;785;1625_ptsd;"Traumatic experience (potential trigger warning) \[Trigger warning: confrontation, potential abuse, self-harm\]

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.

This is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):

A couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.

Then, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to ""listen to her point of view because she had listened to me."" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our ""conversation."" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.

At some point in this ""conversation"" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say ""No"" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said ""nice talking to you guys."" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.

In the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way ""there"".  

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole ""me"" in ways I have never experienced before. In any case, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support anyone might be able to offer.";1
391;391;412_ptsd;"Traumatic hospital stay caused PTSD TLDR: traumatic hospital icu stay caused PTSD 

February 2019 was the best and worst month of my life. I welcomed my biggest blessing my son on feb 4th, then 9 days later that joy turned to the most traumatic thing I’ve ever experienced. 

A quick back story: I had my child when i was 21. The birth of my son was very painless and the whole experience was very positive. No painful contractions, no complications with the csection or anything.

Back to the story. after a csection they give you narcotic pain meds. On feb 13th i started weening myself off the pills because i wasn’t in that much pain anymore. That whole day i felt like something was off in my body. I had chills but my body was hot and i felt nauseous. I figured it was the effects from no longer taking the pain meds. After hours of not feeling well my dad took my temperature and it was 104.3. My dad kept my baby while my boyfriend took me to the hospital. 

Upon arriving and telling them my symptoms i was immediately swarmed my so many doctors and nurses like the scene of a movie. They asked millions of questions and stuck IV’s and sensors all over me. 

Fast forward i learn i have sepsis and a blood clot in my ovarian vein. You’d think those are pretty simple fixes. Wrong. 

I spent 2 weeks in the hospital and i barely have any memory of most of it but i remember flashes. 

During that time i had several blood transfusions, blood drawn every 3 hours everyday for 2 weeks and they stuck me in a different vein every time, got given heparin (blood thinner) for the blood clot which they later realized i was allergic to do they switched me to another blood thinner, got given so many different antibiotics for the sepsis, had 3 different IV’s at the same time and a PICC line, had a foley Catheter and a feeding tube, was in the icu in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator, had to do physical therapy to walk, had to get my lungs drained after catching pneumonia from the ventilator, had to get fluid sucked out of my abdomen via ct machine needle insertion, and so many tests and labs i can’t keep up. 

Was sent home with 11 prescription as well as a blood thinner injection i had to give myself everyday. All while having a newborn at home waiting for me.

Most traumatic experience of my life. It still causes me bad anxiety til this day and it’s even worst a lot more happened that i can’t remember. I was there for 3 weeks but to me it felt like 3 days.

Still a year later i haven’t met anyone who can understand or relate to me regarding the experience";1

I have to be away from everyone and can’t have electronics. I will miss you, Reddit! 
I finished the program I was in with many women who are vets or have husbands serving. I think this was the key for me to really accept my PTSD. I didn’t fully absorb it before seeing these women react to situations and explain their emotions the way I did. We’re not crazy. We aren’t “overly emotional.” You give an asthmatic an inhaler for a reason. You give someone with severe, chronic PTSD skills to avoid panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares for the same reason; in that regard, its all the same. Trauma itself is much like pain: you can’t compare it. It is what it is. When you’re stuck in fight or flight mode, you need to learn skills to turn it off. This is through DBT. I have been panic attack free for awhile now, have not had self harming thoughts, or any other “crazy” feeling that could potentially occur due to PTSD. It’s all brain damage.
Most trauma treatment is voluntary, and you need to find them on your own. I highly recommend each of you find a psychologist- not a “therapist” to treat PTSD. My trauma occurred in my childhood. My psychologist now treats adults, but many of us were abused as children. His background is working with dyfus cases and treating children. Get a good psychiatrist you can trust- I am on 6 medications: 2 for nightmares and sleep, 2 for anxiety, and 2 for depression. NO ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDS BECAUSE IM NOT CRAZY.
PTSD is brain damage, and that’s how it needs to be treated.
I’m extremely mistrusting of the system and had to do this all my way. My husband is a great support, and I know many of you don’t have the support you need. I’m praying for you.
I hit the lottery when I found my psychologist. He wanted me to face my trauma last year by doing this, and I couldn’t because I knew i wasn’t ready. 2 years after starting therapy, I had the courage to do this.
My point is; no matter what state or insurance you have, it’s your responsibility to take care of your mental health to the best of your ability and capacity. 
I wish you all the best as I say bye to Reddit and begin the next chapter in my journey. Going to the west coast VOLUNTARILY so I can leave behind some mistrust, anger, and worry and do what I need to do the right way - no visitors, no contact 30 days. Feels like jail for my broken mind 😩🤪😅🥰

In my head was a clear picture of what was supposed to happen, how it was supposed to happen, and with who it was supposed to happen.
To have that picture ripped out of my mind, taken not by consent but by pure, raw, overwhelming force; of course I was blind to the evil that had stolen what was rightfully mine.
I remember feeling cold, so cold, and so alone after. I was a rag doll, old, used, dirty. I was worthless, and completely utterly in denial. I tried to convince myself it was special, that he cared about me. 
Of course he didn’t, my body was an object, a toy, to be played with and then replaced when broken. And he did just that. He broke me. I shattered into a million different pieces in that moment and every single day I still fight to put myself back together. 
I tried to cut corners; by lying to myself I could fix the problem with duct tape: not permanent, but in the moment it worked. I was temporarily alright, suspended in my own bubble of disbelief. I had blinded myself, because I knew if I opened my eyes and faced reality the tape would come off, and I would be broken once again.

1048;1048;1593_ptsd;"Trigger warning: I think I was r**ed NSFW **spoiler to see if it hides the post I don’t want anyone to accidentally read it and get triggered** :(( This is a full story hopefully it makes sense I am very confused. Background on me: PTSD diagnosed , childhood trauma, I don’t remember a lot of my childhood and continue (as an adult) to go into black out mode when things get tough. I am a virgin who plans to stay one till marriage because of sexual trauma. 

I dated a guy for three months who lied a lot. It was the peak of my drinking problem (70 something days sober). I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend. He would drink nothing. I would go in my room thinking I passed out but we would still do sexual things that was not sex. Remember I am a virgin. 

One night I got so drunk I don’t remember making it to bed. He knew how much I drank. He never said anything. If anything encouraged by buying alcohol for me and my roommate. I woke up the next day with awful vaginal pain. When I peed it felt like my insides were ripped and I had blood in my urine. That lasted for three days before slowly fading away. When I asked my ex about it he said he used three fingers and that’s why. I didn’t think anything of it. 

I got drunk a few more times but not blackout and we do things again. I try to set boundaries with him about it realizing I needed to and he texted me “I didn’t rape you” I didn’t think anything of it because rape is such a triggering thing. I shut it down super quick. 

I don’t know if this is rape or not because when I would get drunk I would ask to have sex but he would say no. He knew I wanted to wait and he wanted to be a good boyfriend. But the three finger excuse didn’t make sense because we consensually used that many before and it didn’t feel that way. I didn’t feel torn and I didn’t bleed. Do you think he waited till I was so unconscious to do something? I didn’t bring up rape in the text but he jumped right in like he was ready to defend himself. I understand it’s a rough accusation but I don’t understand why he jumped to it.  

Do you think this sounds like rape?";1

316;316;213_ptsd;"Trigger warning. It's been an awful day. I don't know that I'm looking for advice, but I need to just get this out.

I'm not currently in therapy, and I know that's what a lot of the responses will be. The short answer is I'm newly insured, and I'm working on it.

I have some sexual trauma in my past, and today I had to see a doctor regarding some of the physical health problems that trauma has caused me. I wasn't prepared. I thought I could go in and just lay it out, and be on my merry way, but apparently the dreaded physical and pap exam was necessary. It was awful. Truly awful it wasn't the doctors fault. She was very compassionate and made sure she laid out the least invasive options, and told me I could tell her to stop, and warned me of what she was doing. She did everything right. But I still froze and cried through the entire thing. Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day.

Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family.

Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day. He came to bed, and asked if I was okay, but he fell asleep in the middle of me trying to describe how I'm not.  I tried to vent to the one friend that I trust with this stuff, but she was busy. I tried a listener on seven cups, and was told to just not worry about it before I could even get it all out. So im throwing this out here as a rant. If anyone has kind words, i would appreciate them, but mostly i just needed to dump it out into the universe somewhere before it swallows me whole.

Also, if anyone has any solid advice on how to successfully get through gynecological exams, that would be actually well appreciated.";0

And I know that can’t possibly be true. Moderators, if this post is at all hurtful it is completely unintentional and I would want you to take it down. I have never started a conversation here before and in no way want to hurt or offend. Here goes... I am diagnosed with PTSD from a violent rape 15 years ago. After many miserable years of escalating symptoms I have been in therapy for 3.5 years. My flashbacks and visceral feelings have been under control for a couple of years until today. I don’t know what it is about the verdict but I feel incredibly out of body at the moment. I feel weak and have had multiple crying jags since getting home from work. I’m a teacher so it was brave face and bury it all day until I could get home. Without getting to much into it, I feel so let down and ANGRY. It feels like how my life used to be on the daily and I just have to get through this evening. If you feel this way too, I understand and you are strong. Sorry for the word vomit.

1103;1103;2352_ptsd;"Triggered by my boyfriend, I don't know how to move forward * TRIGGER WARNING * 


So I have been dating this guy for a few months, and things have moved quite quickly for us. I took the step to be up front about my PTSD and trauma and triggers, and he was extremely positive and helpful! He has always been supportive. 
However, about a week ago, I was at his house, and my mind was absolutely locked onto thoughts involving a recent trauma, I was raped in the spring, and he knew this. I was pacing and out of focus and trying to work through it, and I told him that's what was on my mind.

He continually asked if I was okay, but would interrupt me if I spoke with asking, that was the first sign he really wasn't paying attention (I didn't want extra attention but in case something happened he would at least know which trauma it related to). He then proposed to help me, I said I didn't think there was anything he could do at this moment, and he replied with ""We could have sex, that takes your mind off things!"" 

I was shocked, but also so deep in my mind I didn't react right away. He assumed I did not hear him, so he suggested it again, and I told him now isn't the time. He then started playfully grabbing me and saying he was going to make me feel good, asking for sex, and I was IMMEDIATELY covered in this layer of disgust and discomfort, I felt like gagging. I quickly pulled away and yelled NO, and he then made a 'pouty' face and then turned away from me. 

I was shaking for about five minutes, unable to move, and felt so dirty and ashamed. 
I got up to leave (I was going to leave around this time anyway), and was very quiet when leaving. He gave me a hug, and squeezed me super tight, which made me yell STOP, and rush out the door. 

I have barely spoken to him, and I did get the courage to tell him (through text unfortunately) exactly what happened. He apologized profusely, admitted he should have paid more attention, etc.

But now my issue is, I feel gross even if he messages me. I haven't been able to respond to him. He keeps telling me about his days and then ending with ""oh sorry, I always make it about me,"" and I know him well enough to know he is not intending that statement in a passive aggressive manner, that's just his way of saying he feels he made another mistake through a text.

I feel so guilty because every strong feeling I had for him immediately vanished, I don't want to hurt him, and (selfishly) I don't want to be so alone again. But now he reminds me of the assault in the spring, I dont know how to move forward or mend this situation. 

Sorry for the long post, it's my first one and I felt context was necessary, any advice would be helpful. ";1

380;380;335_ptsd;"Triggering dream (triggers are involved) Any help would be appreciated. So background, in 2012 I witnessed my stepfather kill himself.

There on after I’ve been battling my own thoughts and reoccurring episodes with many negative events in between then and now.

I’ve made many life changes, the most influential including 1 year of seeing a psychologist after being on medications, meeting my boyfriend who keeps me accountable on my actions, and maintaining a healthier life style.

So there’s a few things that keep me from going into a panic attack and recognizing that is key.

However, all my methods of coping today are not working after this dream I had. 
Writing is one of my methods, and I wrote this and I would really appreciate feedback or any insight on why I am not being able to withhold myself today.

“I’m writing this, because I am experiencing and attempting to avoid a full blown panic attack. I am stronger then my negative thoughts, and I do have the power to control them. Writing about it makes it seem less real, and it isn’t. My dream keeps playing in my head like a record and each time i get a glimpse of the record I avoid it. I avoid it as much as I can, because I am at work and I am capable of working a full time job without letting this effect me. So let’s talk about it, I dreamt that any type of thing that supported my idea of killing my self was personified. The first person was Brian, he was in the dream with the bullet hole in his brain with the gun in his left hand telling me “I did it, and you saw me do it. Why would you not want to get it over with? You are going to do it.” Then the sound of him shooting himself replayed in my head echoing. The 2nd person, wasn’t anyone I knew. It was a kid I saw hang himself on morbid reality, after the suicide I developed an almost sexual obsession with observing death. This was the first time I saw it happen on the internet, the same feeling echoed through my brain. The kid told me that it was my turn to be watched by the public. Then the video replayed in my dream with the sound of him struggling for air and finally passing. The third one was my ex husband, who was probably the worst. In the dream, he kept telling me to do it as he cut himself deeper and deeper in his arm. Then he said I’m gonna do it, all because of you too. You deserve to die, then at the end of the dream he kept holding me down to put a knife against my throat and said this is how it ends, just do it yourself.”

I am also looking into talking to someone I can somewhat relate to on this, talking to your friends about this typically doesn’t help me.

Thank you for listening.";1

1136;1136;2146_ptsd;"Triggers and flashbacks 🙁 The fact that I didn’t even think of this until the evening of New Years Day is progress, I suppose. 

For my first job after college, I worked with a nonprofit in a third world country. Several of my American peers in this location discovered that I had never been in a relationship and never been kissed. There were good reasons - I’d spent much of my teens in the hospital, plus I was very committed to waiting for the right guy. 

Anyway, they decided that, this New Year’s Eve, they were going to get me my first kiss. “Everyone should get a kiss on New Years!” they said. “Go to the porch on XYZ building and we will arrange for the cutest guy we can find to come and kiss you!”

I stupidly got swept up in their excitement, and I agreed. 

On New Years Eve, I went to the porch on XYZ building. I waited. 

And up wandered a creepy old guy we worked with. He was easily old enough to be my grandfather. He was not attractive in any way. 

I turned and ran. I got back to my bunk, and when I entered my cabin, my friends (who had all been waiting there) burst out laughing. They just thought this had been the funniest thing imaginable. 

Then they got pissed at me for being angry at them. Why couldn’t I enjoy a harmless prank?

It’s been several years since then. I’ve grown, my ptsd has improved, my life is better... but man, when I remember that night, I still get so angry at them. 

They taught me that I’m not worth respecting, and that no one will ever want to kiss me. Those are hard lessons to unlearn. I can’t understand why they would do that. ";0

I struggle with the normal sounds of cars passing by on the busy road we live on, so as you can imagine, actually creepy things have a HUGE affect on me. It's about 2am as I'm writing this and there's a man pacing around my apartment building, knocking on doors and windows, and it's EXTREMELY triggering, and has induced a lot of paranoia.

I'm not alone (my boyfriend is here) and my doors and windows are locked, as well as the lights off (save for a few lamps that we keep on all of the time). However, the apartment is on the ground floor which gives me anxiety, and I have doubts about the strength of one of the bedroom windows.

680;680;2109_ptsd;"Trouble Coming to Terms with PTSD (Trigger Warning: Sexual Abuse, Domestic Violence) \*\*\*\*Trigger Warning: Sexual Abuse and Domestic Violence\*\*\*\*  


Tl;dr: I experienced stuff that I'm not sure qualifies as traumatic? Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. 

Hey Everyone,   
First time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   


1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. 
2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. 
3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him ""If you're gonna hit me, do it!"" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said ""Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her"". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me ""oh I fight with my brothers too!"" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. 
4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. 
5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that ""if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault"".   


In my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole ""PTSD"" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   
Idk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this. Any comments appreciated.";1

459;459;215_ptsd;"Trouble navigating relationship with veteran I [F28] have been dating a 9x combat veteran [M36] for about 2 months now.  Well call him A. Things have been going well for the most part, with the exception of a small misunderstanding that resulted in him going silent for about 2 weeks. We spoke and moved past that but last night marked our newest miscommunication.

Early in the relationship, A expressed to me that sometimes he has a hard time with seeing blood. That it makes him uncomfortable but he’s good for the most part. We planned to spend this weekend together, sort of a little stay-cation. Yesterday, we arrived at our accommodations, ate a nice meal and I changed into something sexy for him. Things were going great. We had been very excited, this would have been our first time
waking up together. Eventually, we were intimate with each other (not the first time). During sex, I started to bleed a bit. A mild-moderate amount, but enough for him to notice. He immediately went to the bathroom and spent about 5 minutes cleaning himself off. He was very uncomfortable with it. Once we sat back down, he didn’t even touch me. He’s very well endowed, over 8 easily so I suspect that has something to do with it. We discussed this, and that that is most likely what caused the bleeding. He was unable to move on from it. He explained to me that he was having severe anxiety over it, and that he wasn’t trying to be a jerk but that the smell/sight of blood is hard for him as he’s seen so much of it in his life. He shared briefly that he’s smelled blood burning, and seen wounds. I was open and listening at assured him that I want to be there for him and whatever he needs I want to try to do. Eventually, he said he needed to leave to go get his medicine(I’m assuming for anxiety). He kissed me, hugged me and damn near ran out of the hotel room.

I’m struggling with a few feelings at the moment. I feel resentful that he left me, on a weekend we planned together, alone in a hotel room at 10pm and didn’t care enough to text me and check on me last night or make sure I was safe this morning. I feel self conscious that after sex, he sat away from me on the bed as if he was repulsed by me. I’m also empathetic to him, and I want to be there for him and his support system but I’m being shut out. I don’t know what to do. I called once when I woke up, then sent a cute little “sending you smiles” gif.... nothing in return from a man who texts me Goodmorning every day. 

At this point, I suppose the only option is to step back and let him reach out to me when he’s ready, but I’m a communicator and this is 100% opposite of my nature. 

Any advice would be welcomed. Thanks for reading.";1

324;324;366_ptsd;"TW: SA and self-harm/suicide mentioned—Unable to process events healthily 2 years ago I was sexually assaulted by a close friend from an extremely tight-knit group of friends at a party my freshman year at an elite music conservatory. I reported it to the school and was basically called a drunk slut unable to properly recall what happened. I left because I was in a downward spiral and was going to kill myself and was self-harming and not taking care of myself. 

I want nothing more than to move on from it all. I thought one way to move on was to help out a friend-of-a-friend who is a journalism student at my old school who was writing a report on the title ix department there. I was happy to oblige but it became all too much and one night while I was very drunk, I decided to look for some documentation he had asked for, and everything came spiraling back and I began inconsolably crying. For hours, I cried so hard that I woke up my roommate. 

The thing is, that was the first time I even approached anything close to processing my trauma. I have been in therapy since I was 15 and especially since I was assaulted, but I’ve never been able to catharize the deep, conflicting emotional hang ups I have with the friends I sorely, sorely miss; the assaulter whom I can never really escape without shutting out any person from that extremely tightly knit group of friends; the youth/naïvety/innocence I had before all of that. I just want to cry about it, but I’ve compartmentalized and can’t soberly, healthily access the emotional capacity required to let out the anguish, confusion, anger, longing, isolation, desperation, and all of the half-discernible emotions that lie in between.

917;917;1573_ptsd;"TW: violence/sexual abuse. Is it possible that my anxiety is ptsd related? I (24/f) grew up in a favela and had some life events happen to me Why I want insight: from the age 15-18 I tried to self-diagnose a bunch but then by 18 I felt like it was just a regular “growing up and figuring it out” phase. The one label I have identified with since then is the good ol’ “anxiety”. Everyone has it. So in a sense I have felt “normal”. I have worked through a bunch of things that I attributed to how my parents raised me and I would honestly say that I am a generally happy, positive person.

Now, here is what got me started on thinking about this: A few days ago I did coke for the first time ever (I’m not a druggie. All I have done is the somewhat regular weed and occasional alcohol). No big deal. I didn’t trip out or enjoy it. I simply felt nothing from it. I snorted my last dose of it close to 10PM. At around 3AM I tried to sleep. I was at a cheap motel and in the room next us there were some people having a party and talking a little too loud, walking in and out of the room. Sometimes it sounded like they would be walking into my room — a thought which I could easily dismiss but a feeling that I couldn’t shake. I was on full-on alert. I felt as if I was going to be “disturbed”, that something or someone would be making me get up and I was scared. The more I thought of it, the less what I felt seemed cocaine-related, and the more I could think about other times I felt the same way.

So, here is my background:
I am from a neigbourhood called Piedade, in Rio de Janeiro. Born and raised there until I was 8/9 years old. I moved with my family around Brazil until I was 15, at which point we moved to Canada. 
Rio is a dangerous (!!!), violent place. My neighbourhood was a favela. Not the worst one but a favela nevertheless. I can recall most nights falling asleep to the sounds of gunshots. I can’t really recall the sound of gunshots nowadays until I hear one. I have been caught up in the line of fire quite a few times. Most of them were on the streets and we would just stay put in corners of the house. Some of them were while I was out on the streets and had to just scoot down in the car or run and hide inside nearby stores. One of my earliest memories is of me being woken up in a hurry by my parents. They just grabbed me and my brother and took us to the bathroom. Our doors and windows were gridded and someone — or in my memory as a child, something scary — was banging on them. I honestly don’t remember much of that anymore. Just the paralyzing fear, attentiveness, confusion. What happened was that someone was getting followed by a gang to be killed. We had a big yard and this guy jumped into our property. My parents, who were outside, heard neighbours yelling to warn them and they ran inside to get us. The gang arrived, our neighbor was an ex cop, and a shootout happened all around us. But like I said, it’s mostly a feeling to me.
We left Rio when I was 8/9 and I witnessed a lot less of that type of violence. I continued to witness robberies and assaults. A lot of noisy situations. Looking back at it, robbers tend to make their presences known when they are trying to intimidate people with noise.
Anyway, that was until I was 15 and we left to come to Canada.
15 was also just about the age when my dad stopped hitting me. He had some anger bursts for no good reason.
In a few instances in Brazil, and once in Canada, I was groped very indiscreetly.
Then in Canada, once I was 18/19 I was living alone in a basement. I got out of my shower, heard some loud bangs on my door. I froze. Some people burst through, looked at me, ran away. I was shocked but still managed to call the cops right away. I just couldn’t think properly enough to explain it to them in as much detail as they wanted.

So here I am today. I have recurring nightmares quite often. I would say I could go a week having nightmares only. Someone usually dies in my dreams. Most times I am killed in it, other times I am the one killing. Occasionally, in these dreams, someone else will die in front of me. In real life when I hear loud noises my mind freezes. If someone is talking to me after a noisy disturbance I can “go with it” but about 30 seconds to a few minutes later I have to ask them to rewind because I wasn’t “there” anymore. I have really, really, really light sleep. I feel tired all the time. I don’t like spending nights alone at home. Sometimes not even days. If I do, I keep checking on doors, windows and peep behind curtains. If I’m alone I barely sleep or sleep super late until it’s light out. I don’t feel comfortable in loud places (unless there’s rythm/music).

Anyway, like I said in the beginning, I am still a generally happy person. My anxiety, other than what I just described above, is not a big part of my life anymore. But also, what I call anxiety I have usually attributed to that “worrying” feeling that I will fail or something will go wrong because of me and my decisions (money, school). So, I guess I am wondering if what I described is something like ptsd or if I am just being dramatic and trying to label myself again. But also, part of me feels as if I have made huge progress with my anxiety and that it shed a light into something hidden deeper — I have made peace with the things I used to blame for my anxiety, yet some feelings of uneasiness linger on. I was wondering if I could have ptsd to any extent (none or mild to moderate maybe?). 

Please tell me what you think. Personal experiences relating to it and even not relating to it would be appreciated. I’m obviously not going to use your opinions as diagnosis but it would help to have a frame of reference.

273;273;1163_ptsd;"Two stretches you can do at home that actually help make rage and anxiety go away These things seem dumb and I swear to God I didn't think they'd work, but a therapist I had told me about them and they actually do work.

To stop a feeling of rage: Stand straight with your feet apart. Raise your arms as high as you can above your head, and put your hands together (like people do when they're praying). Stretch as high as you can. Jump and land on the floor, bringing your hands down between your legs, and hold that position for a few seconds. Basically it should look like you're holding an axe chopping a piece of wood. Repeat this a few times until you feel your rage subside.

To lessen anxiety: Roll up in a ball. Put your head down by/between your knees (if you can), and wrap your arms around your legs. Squeeze yourself as hard as you can, try to tense all the muscles in your body that you can. Hold for as long as you can (like 5/10 seconds), then release. Repeat over and over until you feel some relief.

900;900;2494_ptsd;"Unresolved Childhood PTSD from a near-death experience Hi there,

So this might be a bit of lengthy ramble, but bear with me. As a kid I used to love horse riding, so so much. I went to a prestigious equestrian school twice a week and did everything from hacking, to showjumping, to novice dressage. I got decent enough that I was really comfortable in the saddle. I loved going cantering because of the thrill, and I had confidence dealing with horses that spooked or acted difficult.

However, one day when I was twelve I fell from horse during a showjumping event. It was a horse hadn't ridden much and wasn't used to its mannerisms. I later discovered I'd broken my coccyx (tailbone) and was in pain for weeks afterwards but because I immediately got back on the horse after the fall and continued to ride for bit, I wasn't too shaken up about it.

About a month later, my parents were looking into buying a horse for me and we thought we'd finally found a good beginner horse. The owners seemed to think this horse was a good match, however, upon riding the horse I discovered that it was extremely flighty. It didn't listen to me at all and would just bolt off in random directions at a full gallop no matter how hard I tried to pull it back. At this point, I started to panic. I didn't like feeling like I wasn't in control of the animal. Eventually it threw me off, hard. I was okay, but determined to see if I could control this horse, I got on again. This was a mistake. The second time it threw me off at a full gallop (around 60km/h) and I landed on my head. I had a bad concussion and couldn't see properly. I also had severe neckpain similar to a whiplash-type injury. I was also very very traumatised by what had happened. I felt paralysed by fear.

After recovering from my physical injuries, I attempted to resume riding lessons but this failed. I couldn't be atop a horse for more than five minutes without breaking down in tears. Every moment I spent on horseback was pure terror, even with sound horses I'd known for years. Nothing seemed to help. My instructor began to get very frustrated with me, and this made me hate myself even more. Eventually my mum sent me to therapy where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Though the therapy was useful and I found myself unwilling to get on a horse again. My experienced had permanently turned me off horses.

So now I'm in my twenties, and considering revisiting the possibility of riding in a controlled environment with very sound horses. Although I don't think I still have PTSD (in that I no longer have nightmares or flashbacks) I am still suffering from a kind of trauma that I wish to heal. On the one hand I'm terrified of getting on a horse again, on the other hand I don't think there's any other way to put this behind me. What should I do?

TL;DR: Had PTSD from falling off a horse and now almost a decade later I'm considering riding again.";1

This is my first time in a while posting in a forum about this. I was pretty badly beaten for a few years by a partner. I have monthly nightmares about him throwing things at me, cursing at me and threatening me with objects, he did much more but for some reason I usually just dream about the anger and intimidation prior to the actual acts themselves. I think because it was that stage that lasted the longest (an hour or two), it hurt me more mentally than the usual 30 seconds to a minute of when he did hurt me physically, Idk maybe easier to block out than the awful screaming and personal attacks.

 I use to wear fun dresses and high heels. I use to go on spontaneous adventures. I use to be so carefree and trusting.

I also have 2 young kids which doen't help either lol. I do try,  I try to self care and do what use to make me happy but it just doesn't work.

I recently started therapy and meds for depression and anxiety and it took a few visits to bring it up , I felt dismissed , she said ""he was young"".

When we walked in, she didn’t seem any worse than the times before... and then a nurse pulled me to the side to tell me it was bad bad. 

I still didn’t believe it, but while we were there they said they were putting her on a ventilator, and I decided to stay the night. 

Due to my moms infection and my slight germaphobia, I didn’t feel comfortable holding her hand or being in cough range. Even before the ventilator, she couldn’t respond more than panicked eyes that never looked directly at me and hoarse “help me”’s between breaths. I couldn’t get her attention even when I did try to tell her it’d be okay and to comfort her. Seeing her like that was crushing me. I decided to let the nurses do their thing while I wished everyone on my social media a happy new year. 

The nurses came in and out to add meds and such to help her breathe, kicked me out to put the ventilator in, but when I was allowed back in they never were gone for more than 10 minutes. I watched my moms machine, and it didn’t stop beeping since we had gotten there but that was normal when o2 levels are below 90. 

She started calming down some so I laid down to sleep. I was checking my phone one last time for the night when a nurse came RUNNING in. 
The machine hadn’t made a different sound or anything but apparently my mother’s heart had stopped. 

Within seconds the room got filled with folks providing CPR. A doctor came in and told me to tell her if I wanted them to stop. 

5 minutes passed, then 7, then 10. It didn’t feel like I though. I’m just sitting there in shock and unsure what to do. The doctor informs me her ribs are broken and if she does suddenly make it she’s gonna be in a ton of pain but at this point we were just torturing her. 

Blood was in her breathing tube. Her eyes looked gone. I told them to stop. 

I remember feeling super numb and floaty. I hadn’t slept in months. My boyfriend wasn’t answering the phone and I didn’t know what the fuck to do but it didn’t matter because I couldn’t think. 

Eventually I just allowed the numb to take over. I had hoped that numb would stay for a bit but starting around February, I started waking up every night at 12:23 no matter when I go to sleep. 

I know why it’s happening, but at the same time, I just can’t get it under control. 

Once I’m awake I can’t go back to sleep until daylight and it’s getting real old. No matter what I take I’ll wake up. 

Luckily my job has been shut down over the Covid stuff, but I’m worried about when I do have to work again. 

Has anyone else dealt with this?

997;997;2485_ptsd;"Want to Share a bit of my Story (TW: sexual abuse) So right now I'm going through a formal process of bringing ti light some sexual harassment I've suffered, and it's triggered me badly regarding the sexual abuse I endured as a very young adult. I have rarely spoken about it since it happened. I was disssauded from being public about it, and I now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. 

Because being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. Now I'm realizing I want to be more open, but I thought the Internet is a good place to start. Part of my issue with sharing is that I can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although I logically know that of course people have. 

This story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile:

Well I began being groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17. I was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so I was the perfect target  At age 18 he started with the sexual advances and I was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. 

He was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was I ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. His wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and I had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. 

And meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). 

In the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.

There were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.

 While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. 

This man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. I never got to complete my university degree because I was trapped under him when I should have been there. Also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now I have several quite severe chronic health conditions.

 I completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. Because I can't work, I can't afford proper health care or therapy. I have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and I don't think I'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. 

I don't live with a victim mentality but I think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me.

Thank you for reading my account because I need to get it out.";1

I was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically.  
My mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us.  He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake.  I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react.  
His mini van hits us right on my door.  I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state.  
It happened exactly like it does in the movies.  In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself.  I expected the car to just stop.  I keep replaying that moment in my head.  Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window.

From the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming. One woman, who I later learned had medical training of some sort, got a clean towel from her house and put it over my eye. Her daughter was on the phone with 911. She was trying to help me breathe but I was hysterical. I ask if everyone in the other car is okay. She says they're all okay, I'm the only one bleeding. 
At the hospital, they take two pieces of glass out of my eye, right below my eyebrow. By some miracle, all I have is a concussion, the stitches from the glass above my eye, lots of bruising and some cuts from the glass. I'm gonna be out of work for 1-2 weeks. The general consensus is that I'm very lucky I didn't die. I have lost about 6 of my old classmates to car accidents alone this year. 
On one hand, I do feel lucky. I should've been in worse shape. On the other hand, to be honest, most days I wake up, I wished it killed me. I feel like I'm trapped in my own life now. Being in cars now is suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box underwater. Loud noises, the smell of smoke, seeing headlights, walking too close to the road, the sound of car horns. Fireworks. Doors closing too hard. Everything scares me. The drives to my doctors appointments are excruciating. I think about what it might've been like if I just died. 
I feel completely out of control of everything. I obsess over everything I can't control now. Natural disasters, house fires, accidents of any kind. I don't want anyone to leave my sight because if I can't see them in front of me, then I don't know they're safe. It feels so unfair this guy just got to rip away my peace of mind. I've become so preoccupied with control. What I can control, what I can't control, what others around me can control. 
I have PTSD already, from childhood abuse and a sexual assault that happened two years ago. I also have OCD which is probably responsible for my new obsessive thoughts. 
Maybe it's dramatic. My injuries are minor compared to what could've happened. But I feel completely broken. I want to stay positive but I'm really struggling with the idea of this being my reality forever. This has destroyed me in a way I could never describe to someone who hadn't felt it.";1

So I’ve had severe PTSD for years, everything from a life threatening illness, watching a week old baby being revived back to life, to abuse and  a victim of assault. We recently had a major incident at my workplace that resulted in some of my close coworkers being very seriously injured, and one of our clients being arrested. I wasn’t actually present at the time it happened, but I was there in the aftermath to clean things up, and help others figure out the rest of their schedules for the week. I feel awful for feeling traumatized, but at the same time, I left only moments before the incident occurred and it happened very close to my office. The room reeked of old blood and the atmosphere felt tense and scary. I never thought my work family and I would go through something like this. My heart hurts and I don’t want to diminish those directly involved but the events have been triggering a lot of emotions.";1

2016: The hellhouse explodes in the middle of the night while I'm inside, catches fire, and burns down. No insurance. Bunch of animals die. Sad. Those were basically my only friends. I run away in the middle of the night and don't tell my family. Got 850 miles away. Drove from South Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, to Eastern Nebraska in two days. Stayed in my car. Stayed on the couch of someone I only knew from the internet. Rented a room in a house with strange guys from craigslist. Got screwed out of that and given the wrong date for move out. Had to leave asap. Rented a room in another house sight unseen. Hoarder lady. Cat shit in a room. No cat. Doors don't lock on the house. Random people show up and drop things off for my landlady. I have no idea who they are, they just walk in and leave shit. Can't find/afford anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

2017: Finally manage enough money for an apartment. Worked 6 days a week. Worked sick. Get apartment. Calm down. Have safe/private space. Hate Nebraska though. Feel anxious. Tornadoes in the summer. Hail every spring. Ice/snow in winter. Icy roads I'm not used to driving on. Scared of the environment all the time. Car engine dies that fall. Sink my savings into having to buy another car off craigslist. Can't afford to be without a car. Had gotten a better paying job at a call center during this year, but still struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

2018: Start trying to recover savings. That fall apartment building gets struck by lightning while I'm inside. Lightning. It also burns down. Insurance doesn't cover everything. Now in debt. God is pursuing me with fire. Reality isn't real. I am destined to die. I am being pursued. Something is after me. Why is this happening again? Brain goes to space world. Resume brief homelessness and stress of recovering after fire #2. Red cross offers no help to even transport me anywhere because I have 2 dogs. My phone is in the burned building. I have no family or friends nearby. I don't even have shoes on. Mental state falls apart. Can't take time off work long due to money. Cause problems with boss/at work due to emotional instability/unwillingness to take a schedule change. Boss says I should bring him a doctors note saying I have problems after I oversleep one day due to having a panic attack the night prior. Ignores that he gets medical insurance in this company and I don't. Tells me he thought he had been very lenient by letting me have 5 days off after the fire. Never get doctor's note. Live in fear.

I am scared when I have to drive, and terrified when it is in snow. I am scared of my bosses. I am scared of losing my job. I am scared of calling in when flashbacks and panic attacks interrupt sleep. I am scared of becoming homeless again. I am scared of wasting time feeling miserable only to die before anything gets better. I am indignant and frustrated that I cannot motivate myself to try any harder to get out of here. I am angry I do not have any parents to fall back on or ask for help or money. I am angry there is no way for me to easily get to Oregon. I am angry I feel as tired as I do and people are still mean.

455;455;514_ptsd;"What are some things you wish a significant other knew, or would do, when you have flashbacks? (Possible triggers in background summery) 
Some background, 

My boyfriend and his father never had a good relationship for a multitude of reasons. His father shot and killed himself in front of my boyfriend and his mother a couple months ago. My boyfriend had panic attacks and PTSD before the death of his father, but after this event, it has gotten completely worse and elevated to a whole new level. He has nightmares that keep him up all night, and he gets flashbacks throughout the day, worsening at night. He relives that moment over and over again. 

(He is seeing a therapist, and is on several different medications.)

This has been an extremely tough time for him.  I don’t feel right saying this has been hard on me, but it has been hard knowing what to do or what to say. 

When you are experiencing flashbacks, what can someone do to make it easier? Or to help ease the pain of reliving the traumatic experience? 

Do you have any advice for someone who doesn’t have PTSD, but is trying to understand it so they can better help a loved one who is having a tough time with it? 

Any advice is welcomed. ";1
772;772;2641_ptsd;"What are your flashbacks like? (possibly triggering for sexual abuse, rape, trauma) Hi everyone,

I'm pretty new to this sub and would like some insight into what others feel when they are experiencing flashbacks.

BACKGROUND INFO (skip if you want)

To give some background information on my experience, I was sexually abused/raped(?) by my step dad 4 years ago (and sexually abused by him multiple times over many years before) but I didn't get any medical help for that although I did tell my mum and boyfriend about it after the ""big happening"". I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. 

**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. 

For me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. 

Why do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   

TL;DR

my flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?

Backstory: I moved to a new state and started a new job a little over 2 years ago, and while I get along with people fine, I don't make friends easily because of my trust issues. Still I managed to make good friends with one of my coworkers. For almost a year, we hung out almost everyday and did pretty much everything together (including vacations) and were very close. She even brought me with her when she took a new job.

I got badly triggered during the Kavanaugh/Ford media debacle. My friend wanted me to talk to her about what was going on with me and I resisted for a long time. (I lost my last best friend 10 years ago after telling her about my rape, so I generally keep shit to myself now.) Eventually I opened up and told her. Her reaction sucked, but she has lived a pretty privileged and trauma-free life so I didn't expect her to get it. And then we stopped hanging out. Suddenly she was always busy, and found other people to spend all her time with. She was my only friend in this whole state, so it sucks a lot. Worse, we share an office and many job responsibilities. So we still have to communicate and I have to pretend like it doesn't hurt.

711;711;2369_ptsd;"What do you think, do i have ptsd? Or something else? This is my first post and and would like to know your opinion. What do you think of my situation? What would you do?  

Iam 24 years old and for more than a decade iam suffering. My current situation is really difficult. This year i wanted to go to university again, but my medical condition is a living hell. My problem is my body is 24/7 in an ""emergency situation"". That means it feels to me like my own body is a prison/enemy to me. I can barely breathe, i dont sleep well (for years) and my stomach is so hard to the point i feel emotionless. It feels to me this is taking 80% of my energy. Over the year  ""being depressed"" became the new normal for me.

The relationship to my parents is really difficult. I experienced a lot of abuses. Want some examples?
- At age 7 i was trying to sleep in a room with my brother in the evening. I was scared of ""monsters"" under the bed, so i asked my little brother if he could come to sleep beside me (children), so i dont need to be scared anymore. A few moments later my fundamental religious father came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground. Then he started to beat my little childrens body with his foot. My stomach hurt was hit by his foot. 1 Minute later my mum came to him, but she just observed and didnt do anything. Then it began to hurt so much, i was thinking i would die. So i crawled on my knees to my mothers feet and told her  ""mommy please tell him to stop"". But he kept going by this time punching me in the face, so blood came out of my nose. As he noticed the blood, he grabbed me by my t-shirt and pulled me like a dog to the bathroom, where he forced me to wash my blood. I was so little i couldnt reach the water so he gave me something to stand above. While cleaning the blood i was crying and most importantly my body was vibrating enormously.

- At age 8 i should take my little brother to play with my friend outdoors. Like most children i wanted to play with my own friends and don't want to ( Alone the fact letting a 5years and 8 years old playing for several hours alone on the street is crazy). Then my father saw me coming down the street and asked where i was, i said ""i was on the playground"". As he knew i didnt take my brother with me, he was so aggressive i got scared of him. I literally was so scared i began to run away from him. I ran the street down and now comes the crazy thing. He began to run wild after me and i screamed as loud as a i could ""HELP"", but nobody noticed. As i couldnt run anymore, i instinctively put my hands before my face, in fear he would punch me in the face. 

-At Age 6 i behave badly in the opinion of my parents and they scared to beat me, so i left the building block and waited infront of the bus stop for several hours in the cold. I Brief the whole time and each time a bus come by (every 20 minutes) i started to control it, so no stranger noticed me. Every two minutes i looked to the door, to look if they let me in again.

- At age 16 i was really hungry and cooked a little meal for myself. My father told me i should share it with my brother. I told him no, there is enough left he can cook for himself, he is old enough. He was so angry he took my plate with the food on it and threw it in front of me into the garbage. Then he became more aggressive and and destroyed the plate with a spoon in front my eyes and forced me to clean everything up. At this time school already was really hard for me emotional, so i cried silently desperate while cleaning everything.

- One day at age 15 or so he came in a aggressive mood in my childrens room ( dont remember why), we had a discussion and then began to threat me by coming really near to me, holding his fingers between his teeths saying ""iam craazy"".";1

I feel dizzy, tired, like I am looking at the world and it is through a screen or just altered. It doesn't feel right. I feel on edge like I could panic at any moment and that I can't handle anything. Face numb. Does anyone else feel that way? Sometimes it lasts for weeks. Most times when it's long term I get a couple hours where it is less a day but still present. ;1

I'm a little bit tipsy. Realised alcohol helps me open up to myself - obviously this isn't healthy. But I am thinking about things more than I usually can bare to do, which is good. 

Diagnosed with PTSD 1 year ago, no therapy since (for complicated, various reasons) 

Given it's 2018 and I want to do better for myself... what has helped you? 
Any advice for dealing with PTSD? Complex PTSD? 

Thank you everyone, happy 2018, I hope we can all stick together and try as hard as we can to do the best for ourselves. 
Life is more than how we know it. 

I love you!

834;834;2421_ptsd;"What if my hurt and issues (disorganised attachment) stem from an innaccurate perception of my memories about my parents? so uuuuuuuh yeah this post carries a content warning for parental abuse, chiefly physical, I think?

I'm 27, a trans woman, pre-anything, and I'm in therapy. I initially started going because I felt like I generally needed support with being almost entirely closeted outside of the net and needing help with getting the support of my parents. The more I stayed on the more the subject became 'me' overall, and over the year or so I've been in therapy now it's the most productive it's been, rather than just doing tunnel vision on a specific problem. She's on leave right now.

I ended up describing some difficulties I was having with relationships and even just general socialising and it lead to us doing the adult attachment interview. In the course of that, I was describing stuff with my parents. I described some particular incidents where I remembered being pushed against a hard plastic prop in a theme park when I was a kid, another when my mother screamed at me and threw my own shoes at me, and another where I remembered her grabbing me, spinning me around and shoving me onto a curb before storming away. In each of these instances, I had been annoying them prior in some fashion, or misbehaving. There's probably a few others, but those stood out.

I told my therapist about how I would remember these events, rather vividly, every few weeks or so and that the more I talked about my parents over the sessions - which took some effort, as I would avoid the subject earlier on - the more frequently I thought about them. And apparently that, uh...apparently that's not normal? Prior, I had just assumed it was normal to keep remembering stuff like that. We got to the end of the interview, over the course of 3 sessions because I kept crying during it. High on anxiety, high on avoidance. Congratulations. It's a Fearful-Avoidant.

We continued talking about these things, still do. It was the first time someone referred to what I went through as incidences of abuse. I would always just say to myself, before this, that I couldn't have been abused because my parents cared about me, or it didn't count as abuse because it was inconsistent, because I was never routinely or ritualistically beaten, or that it didn't count because I deserved it.

A few weeks ago, my mother accused me of disrespecting her after not responding to some asinine suggestion. I ended up being made to sit in front of my parents and made to tell them why I will talk about things to a therapist without telling them. So I was upfront about it - 'you have a history of treating me with anger and violence'.

I was immediately met with incredulity. I was made to outline the events. I named them. One of them - the shoes - she said she didn't remember.  Two others - spinning me around and put to the curb, and being shoved against a prop at Legoland - she says I was misremembering. The former, she just pushed me away because I was being (her words) 'such a horrid thing', the latter, she says I fell and they were helping me up (I have cerebral palsy, balance issues - results in overprotective helicopter parents, to boot). Now, I'm not going to say she was wrong. These were years ago. More than a decade. Nearly two decades in one instance. And every time you remember something, you make an imperfect photocopy of it. My perception, built up over the years as I somehow drifted further and further from my parents, may not be perfect.

She then went on to ask me if I remembered one time that she definitely did hit me - I said I didn't. She explains an instance where she slapped me, because I was misbehaving, and she was mortified afterwards. 'See, you're remembering it wrong, it's all made up.' I felt like we were approaching something, because at least here she was admitting, of her own accord, to some wrongdoing.

Then, she said 'It was probably even just the shock of it then, I didn't hurt you.' My face fell. She admits to actually hitting me once, then justifies it with simultaneous 'you deserved it' and 'it wasn't even a real hit'.

That's the thing that kept me grounded. That wasn't okay. It wasn't okay to justify it. It wasn't okay to effectively corner me and make me spill the beans over what's going on in therapy because I'm seen as property. But still, the doubt remains - what if I'm wrong about this stuff that happened to me? What if I'm remembering it a certain, innaccurate way, and it's colouring my perception of everything else?

Even if my memories are wrong, though, the effects are there. I struggle with relationships. In bad days I dread getting up and seeing my parents. I feel anxious at mealtimes when I have to be near them. I am very apprehensive about the notion of going on vacation with them. I had trouble talking about them in therapy and when my therapist suggested a roleplay for tackling a subject, I just locked up and couldn't do it. That shit just doesn't come from nowhere, right? And if you want to look at fearful-avoidance as springing from your primary caregivers simultaneously giving you a lot of love and a lot of pain, well that day, where I'm being held and told that they'll 'support me' as a trans person while justifying and denying shit that my mother did to did to me, all from effectively forcing me to answer questions (understand, 'leave the room' is not something that presents itself as an option in my mental landscape) and prioritise my mother's pain over 'being disrespected' above all else, *that's* a big fucking dose of that.

Sorry for the long post. It's just all so fucked.";1
419;419;522_ptsd;"What is wrong with me? Do I have PTSD? Hello,  

I’m a 25 year old woman that turns 26 in exactly two weeks, and I couldn’t fathom being anymore depressed than I am now. When I was 14 and a new sophomore in high school , I met this 22 year old man (I’ll call him The Man) via my friend who was 14 as well. At the time I didn’t know how old he was and he and my friend’s sister (16) were dating. Somehow, the man got my phone number and consistently and persistently texted me until I stopped ignoring him and began texting back. 

I didn’t like him at first, but after weeks of texting nonstop, my 14 year old self somehow fell for him. I knew he was involved with my friend’s sister, and it ate me alive, but I also had feelings for him. One day, when my mom wasn’t home, I invited him over for the first time. We met at my neighborhood pool, and we sat in his car and talked in person for about an hour. When it was time for me to leave, he wrestled with me for about 10 mins trying to kiss me, and when I finally submitted, the only thing I could say was that his breath smelled. He left, and we continued to text. 

A week later, my friend’s sister (who was in my orchestra class) gave me a note basically cursing me out for “kissing her man” and calling me a fat slut, which hurt because although I’m no where near obese, I’ve always struggled with my weight, and she knew that. I crumpled the paper up and threw it at her telling her that he has been persistently pursuing me. It was a big thing and I almost got kicked out of class. I was really hurt, but I knew I was wrong. I texted him and asked him why he told her, and he said he didn’t want to keep a secret from her, and that he couldn’t see me anymore. I was extremely hurt and didn’t really understand what had happened. He began to ignore me, but would sometimes call me and leave messages about how sorry he was. This all took place around this time this year, the fall. 

I fell into a depression, being that this was my first romantic encounter, and it was so negatively toxic, I didn’t know what to think or do. I stopped eating and lost a bunch of weight. Being that I couldn’t talk to anyone about this, my family thought I had developed an eating disorder. This lasted a couple months. Then in December, around Christmas break, I started getting prank phone calls. They would call about twice a day, and after about a week, the person came clean and turns out it was The Man.  He told me that he and my friend’s sister ended things because her mom found out about their relationship. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. Elated, I told him I loved him too and agreed to being in a relationship with him. 

When school started back in January, he would come over after school every Wednesday. My single mom worked a lot, and I took advantage of that. We happily “dated” for exactly a month, until one day, he told me that my friend’s sister wanted him back and wanted to work on their relationship. He also told me that while they were dating, they were sexually involved, something that he was not getting from me. He began breaking up with me saying that she was first. I was distraught. I thought that giving him what she could give him, would make him stay with me. While crying, I told him I would have sex with him. He decided to take me up on that offer. I told him I was scared and asked him if it would hurt and he said it would. He laid me down, and told me to open my legs. I was crying and scared, so he forced them open. I don’t remember it actually happening, but I do remember after it happened, he told me to tell him that he broke me. I told him that he broke me, and he left, not changing his mind about ending things. I cried all night. 

He continued to text me, and see me even while dating the sister. We would have sex, and my attachment to him became really deep, scary deep. About 2 months later, I snuck out in the middle of the night to meet him in my neighborhood and I got caught by the police. The police also found him, but let him go. They brought me home and told my mom. She was livid. She told me that she was pressing charges. She called me a slut and a whore and took my phone. I found a way to contact him and told him what was going on. My mom contacted him and wanted to meet up with him. I don’t know what that meeting looked like or how it went but they met, and afterwards, he told me he couldn’t talk to me anymore, and my mom didn’t press charges. 

About a year later, I received an email from him saying he missed me. Our secret relationship started up again, but this time it was a bit different. His twin brother was dating this 17 year old girl that I went to school with, so naturally, the girl and I became friends to be each other’s cover. We would all hangout together and one time we all were in the same bed and having sex, but not with each other. I met some of his other siblings and had to lie about my age when they said I looked so young. He would also give me alcohol. There was a time that I went on a weekend trip with him and his brother to visit their friend (24). We stayed at the Friend’s house who was celebrating his girlfriend of 6 years’ birthday. It was a big celebration because she was finally turning 18. The Man had friends like him and even his twin brother was like him. About a week later, I found out that he gave me chlamydia and when I told him about it, and that he was the only guy I’ve ever been with, he denied it and said that I must’ve gotten it from a toilet seat or something. Somehow, my entire high school found out that I had an std. I don’t know how, but I continued to date him. On the same date that he broke up with me the year before, he broke up with me again, stating that I was too young. He still continued to see me and have sex with me, just without the title of being in a relationship with me. This allowed him to see other people, which I didn’t understand. 

About 2 weeks later, my mom found out and this time actually pressed charges. She took me to talk to a detective and I remember hating her for that. I didn’t tell the detective everything but I told him some things and that I loved him. The Man decided to turn himself in and I didn’t talk to him again after that. My mom was extremely mad at me for months. I knew she was disappointed in me, and every chance she got, she let me know. 

When I started my senior year of high school, things were a lot more normal. My mom was trusting me again, and even got me a car. I had a boyfriend that was my age, that she approved of. One day, at a Friday high school football game, I saw The Man. I was there with my boyfriend and avoided The Man. He stared at me and watched me. When the game ended, he texted me and said that he sees I moved on. I said yeah. 

The case against him was still going on. A few months passed and he contacted me begging me to ask my mom to drop the charges because he was facing 20 years. I told him that I would talk to her. He then asked me to marry him and said that if I marry him, the charges would automatically drop and that he could get us an apartment. He said we could start a family and that he would take care of us. I seriously thought about it, and then declined. I told my mom that he contacted me and she was mad at me. A few months later, I found out that she worked out a deal to bring his sentencing down to him being on probation for 10 years and being on the sex offender’s list for 3 years. 

At the time, my teenage self moved on from the situation very quickly. However when I turned 25 last year, all the memories and emotions I suppressed hit me like a ton of bricks. Ever since I was 16, my body has been sick. I have acne all over my body, irregular periods, mood swings, regular yeast infections and vaginal infections and have had terribly toxic relationships with men. I think that every guy I encounter has given me an STD. For the last two years, and being sexually active once out of those two years, I have been trying to convince myself that I do not have HIV even after testing negatively several times. I’m starting to believe I’m traumatized. 

 I always feel like I have to please any male I encounter, and that I need to work hard and give him everything I have to avoid him leaving me. I’m overtly sexual and think that I must be a pornstar in order to receive love from the male kind however, I don’t really know what intimacy is. 

I don’t have healthy relationships at all. If I befriend a female, after a couple months, I cut her off and stop talking to her. 

I have dreams of being a doctor, but now think that I’m incapable of achieving something like that. My confidence is shot, and I hate myself. 

I feel guilty for The Man having to spend nearly all of his 20s on probation. I hate myself for being such a fast and loose little girl. I hate what I did to my mom and my sister. 

I still live at home, in the same bedroom where all of this took place and it’s starting to swallow me whole. I’ve been having flashbacks of what happened and I hate myself for that.

 I don’t know who I am anymore and I’m scared to interact with people or even exist on this planet. Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I’m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don’t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. 

Im in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I’ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I’ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can’t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I’ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I’m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I’m always alone and always will be. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.";0

91;91;1066_ptsd;"What to do when it feels like too much? I opened the can of worms recently (a few years ago), and started dealing with my trauma. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 16.  Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. 

*My dad did drugs
*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once
*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once
*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)
*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.
*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)
*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we ""misbehaved"" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.
*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. 
*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. 
*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. 
*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.
*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.
*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. 
*I was in a ""relationship"" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).
*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. 

All of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.

I want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old. I want a chance to be 5 again. But I don't want to die.

I don't know what to do.

855;855;2656_ptsd;"When you have PTSD how much of bein in fight or flight is legitimate or an excuse? My girlfriend has had PTSD since she was a teenager and has come a long way in her mental and emotional health. I try my best to understand and be supportive. It can be hard to always understand though. We have excellent communication and openly talk about mistakes we make and when we feel hurt by each other. It seems she often pins her mistakes on being in 'fight or flight mode'. There are a lot of circumstances where this is understandable and having been raised by a verbally abusive dad I can relate to an extent. However, it's hard to understand when a simple question, or text message, awkward situation sends her into fight or flight. 

I can't help but wonder how much of what is triggering is legitimate and if she's using fight or flight as an excuse for her behavior. This is difficult because of the level of maturity we strive to have in our relationship. On my end, it feels like she thinks that every mistake she makes must be because she's in fight or flight. Some of the situations sound like things that I and others have a hard time with too, but learn to recognize and deal with. It feels like she's not trying to overcome her difficulties by handicapping herself with fight or flight and other PTSD related issues. 

I really want to understand and help her. If PTSD is simply that difficult to deal with I want to know so that I can understand her perspective better and be patient. But if this is a crutch she's leaning on too much, I want to help her take steps to empower herself and move forward with her life and healing. 

My question is, does having PTSD send you into fight or flight over little things frequently? If so, how have you found is the best way to heal from that response? What do you recommend I do to better support my girlfriend? 

Edit: the bein in the title should be being. 

Edit 2: Thank you all for your input. It's helpful to see more perspectives and how you each deal with your PTSD. Thank you for sharing. From what you've said it looks like PTSD can trigger fight or flight frequently from what may seem to be little things. I want to clarify, I made this post because I want to do my best to be supportive for her. I'm committed to helping her with her mental and emotional health goals however I can. I'm going to do my best to talk to her about her triggers and just listen as much as I can. Thank you again for the suggestions.

228;228;1070_ptsd;Why I have ptsd.. When I was in middle school, I was bullied a lot. Physically. I've been assaulted a few times from women when I was a teenager. I remember in 5th grade I got off the bus and two women jumped me, broke my nose and left me bloody.. a few months later another woman assaulted me at school, and would throw me against the locker(she was much older than me). I also got in multiple fights with people and I saw some fucked up shit like a cat getting ripped to shreds by my own dog.. After that I would see dead animals on the side of the road and break down in tears. I was a bully in school too. always built with rage. One time a kid jumped on my back and bit my shoulder and In response I body slammed him on the concrete because he freaked me out. I put him in the hospital and his dad threatened to kill me (I was 13, He was in his 40's). I was going to be charged with assault even though I was defending myself unless I wrote my bully a letter saying that I'm sorry. The reason I was in the wrong is because I'm a huge dude and he was half my size. It was fucking stupid. I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive. I left town when I was 18 and moved to Seattle, got a job at McDonald's and started therapy. I had a suicide attempt that same year and that put me in the hospital for a few weeks. I left my job at McDonald's a few weeks later, got a job at amazon and started making something of myself. But I struggle around people, I always have. My coping mechanism is painting, I'm an artist outside of work and it's something I care deeply about. I'm thinking of leaving Amazon to become an artist because that's what I want to do. I don't care if it's hard, I've had a lifetime of hardship so I know what hard is. Anyways this is more of a rant than an explanation. I had a very abusive childhood and it's made me have thick skin, It's why I am the man I am.. ;0
462;462;1148_ptsd;Why is my mother acting this way? My mother abused physically for many years and now have ptsd. I have been diagnosed by 2 adolescent physiatrists and now I am being forced by the court system to attend reunification therapy with her which is terrible. I always feel unsafe and am on red alert. My mother has narcissistic personality disorder and cannot accept that I have ptsd. Is it because deep down she knows that she abused me. Also she has never admitted to anyone but me that she has abused me and claims that I am making everything up. My personal therapist says that I am being revictimized  by having therapy with her while she claims that nothing happened.;1
507;507;1077_ptsd;"Why is this happening? Hi, I don't really know where to begin. I'll just do my best to keep this short. 

I have PTSD from an incident that occurred 9 years ago. It debilitated me for years, and I am only now starting to get my life on track. I am also starting, very slowly, to date again. 

I had someone over tonight after being very clear that touching was totally off the table. He was totally respectful, he was very nice, and I never felt uncomfortable or pressured. I even hugged him goodbye. 

However, after he left, I was flooded with terror. I started to break down, and I almost split; I had to talk myself down from a total dissociative flashback, which I haven't had since August. 

Why??? He didn't do anything, nothing triggering happened. And it happened after he left. 

I'm sitting in bed, too afraid to smoke (I have medical marijuana for these occasions) because I'm worried it will incapacitate me and I won't be able to get away if I need to. I am so scared right now and I don't know why this is happening or what to do. 

It's been almost a decade and I just don't understand this disorder

260;260;520_ptsd;Will I ever be normal again? I’ve been dealing with ptsd for around 4 years now. Honest to god, I didn’t think I’d make it this far when it first happened, but I’m glad I did because I’ve become a whole different person. I see things in a different light and have a whole new outlook on life. But I wanna know if anyone’s ever fully gotten over their ptsd? I’ve tried so many therapists, medications, everything under the sun basically. And my last resort would be the move out of where I live, (where everything happened.) I’m just tired of having triggers and it never stops. It’s an ongoing thing every single day and I just want to feel normal again. If anyone has any advice, that would be great.;0
848;848;2064_ptsd;"will i ever trust someone enough again my first real boyfriend sexually assaulted me. it was the first time ive ever trusted someone to do anything sexual with me. i dont really know if i trusted him that much, but i felt like i owed him sex. he was very rough with me. and i didnt know how to tell him to stop. he made me feel bad when i said no and would keep asking until i said yes. i have flashbacks multiple times a day. i get triggered if someone brushes against me or touches me. i get triggered discussing sexual things or even hearing the word “sex”.  my worst trigger is if something touches my breast even slightly. 

i dont think i can trust someone again to have a relationship let alone sex. i have sworn off men because any man will trigger me. i will only date girls because i feel like it wont be all about sex. my feelings towards men are very strange. the thought of a guy is very lustful to me  and overly sexual. and sometimes im impulsive and download tinder but then i realize how stupid im being. but if a man ever touched me i would freak out. is that normal to have thoughts like that? my main question is will i ever trust anyone enough to let them have sex with me? it doesnt seem possible at this point. can i have a relationship without sex? if i say no will my partner stop?";1
937;937;1520_ptsd;"Will this go away? About a year and a half ago I had a traumatic experience involving a law enforcement no knock raid on my apt in college. I was a college student never seen a gun before. But there was about 10 police units and one army truck at 645am .They bust in my apt w big long guns w red scope and point at my face they roughed me up and pushed me against wall w gun to my head nothing was in my apt and charged they had against me were dropped i had guns pointed at me as I walked outside I went thru hell w this situation for about almost a year until I got it resolved and it ruined a lot of aspects from my life at the time. After it happened I was having nightmares of police and swat teams coming in my house it would be dreams where the doorbell would ring and I would look outside and see police cars surrounding my house and dream would end.. I wake up sweating and in extreme fear.. I’m reminded of this when I see police officers in public now and everything comes back.. A level of anxiety and overall fear has been added to my life after this experience and I thought it would go away after awhile but it hasn’t.. i was wondering to you all if this sounds like PTSD? And should I talk to someone

381;381;927_ptsd;"will this leave a permanent mark on me? possible trigger warning! 

hi, im 14 y/o and ive just realised my sister's boyfriend has been grooming me. ive talked to some people on r/SuicideWatch and r/survivorsofabuse and they were all very kind and helpful and i appreciate the time they took to warn me, a lot.

long story short, I met my sister's boyfriend when i was about 10-11. hes probably 30 right now and my sister is turning 30 soon. he has been touching me inappropriately for a long time now and it was until recently that i figured out this was wrong. he seemed like such a cool and nice guy to whom i could talk about videogames and tv shows with.

will this leave a permanent mark on me? i don't want to develop ptsd, i want to live a normal life. a few years ago when i started researching more about mental health and i came across ptsd it seemed like such a serious thing to me, which i guess it is, but i never thought id get to the point of thinking im at risk. i understand you guys can't diagnose me and im ok with that. i just want to compare my experiences to someone who has gone through the same things.

somehow this is all my fault. i did this to myself. i think it was like 2 years ago when i told him the tv in my living room had some porn channels in it. he didn't believe me so he started searching for them until he found one. we ended up watching porn together, another time i woke up before him and saw him stroking himself (he probably thought i was asleep), today he asked me if id wear lingerie after touching me on my thighs, waist and resting his head on my shoulder while playing a sexual hentai videogame. i can't help but think im the cause of this. im a teen, sexual thoughts do cross my mind but for some reason i think im the one who kickstarted the situation im in for even daring to think about anything sexual. ive never been so ashamed of myself.

can i live a normal life after this? i feel like im overreacting to this even though ive been told my reaction is perfectly normal. i wish i could forget all of this. i don't even feel like a normal person anymore, everything feels like a bad dream that im going to wake up from any minute now, the world doesn't even look real.";0
235;235;1104_ptsd;"Wonderful experience with Prozac I've been in therapy on and off for about 4 years now, following a traumatic incident. I got a new therapist in early 2016 who eventually diagnosed me with PTSD and recommended twice weekly sessions.

I found myself feeling worse than I ever had before (my main trigger, unfortunately, is extremely commonplace and something most people enjoy). 

HOWEVER- my GP prescribed me prozac for a totally unrelated health issue (PMDD- essentially being an emotional wreck for a week before each menstrual cycle).

After being on the prozac for a few months it has made such an incredible difference in my life, my coping, and my ability to navigate the world when I'm ""triggered"".  I don't feel dulled, don't have any side effects other than reduced appetite, and generally feel so much more capable and in control. My panic response has greatly reduced (though not completely disappeared, naturally) and I find myself less reactive and miserable when I'm forced to face issues and situations that previously caused me a great deal of anguish and anxiety.

I've heard plenty of negative stories, so clearly this medication isn't for everyone, but I thought I'd post about my positive experience just in case anyone is weighing their options.

86;86;1366_ptsd;"Wondering if I have trauma and what to do about it I already have a therapist and psychiatrist for bipolar, among other things, but I think that going through a time where I was severely ill and suicidal may have traumatised me. It was about a year ago and lasted probably six months, and I keep having flashbacks to that time, with many different triggers. I have also been dissociating really badly, as in constantly, for the past few months because I was triggered badly right before. I feel like it doesn’t count because ptsd is such a serious illness and it wasn’t any kind of cut and dry traumatic event, and what if I’m just being silly and these sorts of flashbacks are just normal? Does anyone have a similar situation or any words of advice? I’m talking to my therapist about it and since she’s a bipolar specialist I think I might look elsewhere to look for a diagnosis or other treatment. Thanks for reading :)

Edit: also a lot of the posts I see on here/other places make me feel worse as I had no abuser who did this to me, and also because I was so old, (I was 14), and most people seem to have been children. I kind of know this is irrational it just makes it harder to believe that I actually have trauma and belong here.";0
63;63;94_ptsd;"Wondering if I should get checked for PTSD from familial violence I'm 21, male, and during my childhood I was constantly tormented by 3 people, my dad, my brother, and my aunt. I'd never consider myself to potentially have PTSD but looking up symptoms online made me have a second thought about it. 

My 15-year-older-than-me brother choked me several times during my childhood, possibly with the intent of killing me, because he wouldn't let go until someone would intervene. He started choking me when I was 12, which would make him in his mid 20s. He was NEET back then and still is. He also tortured me in several other ways, like subduing me and pressing his knee into my temple or heatbutting me in the nose as a way to start a fight. I started taking martial arts and self defense classes and I started retaliating against him, when I was around 15. He'd also hit my mom sometimes and I'd protect her. One time while trying to avoid his chokes I cut my head so bad that blood was gushing all over the room - and when I got him off me, he came back and headbutted me in the nose and tried to choke me again, after which I threw him over the table. The whole room was covered in my blood and he was still relentless.

My aunt had epilepsy and blamed it at me since I was 10. She refused to take meds for it because of me and I'd have to take care of her epilepsy attacks since I was 10, a lot of the times I was home alone with her. Sometimes she'd bang her head and get a huge swelling or blood would be pooling out of her head and I had to take care of her alone countless times. Sometimes after the seizures she'd get really confused, almost insane, babble, take her clothes off and try to go off etc, and I had to stop that. Also, watching someone twitch and curl up and their eyes roll up isn't exactly a pleasant thing to watch, especially as a kid.

6 months ago I beat my brother up, choked him until snot was coming out of his eyes because he was threatening my mom and she finally kicked him out. I'm finally free from his constant threat of violence but I still feel really weird from time to time.

My aunt also had her last epilepsy attack around a few months ago, because the doctor said the next one might kill her because it's taking a toll on her heart. Still blames me for it though.

My ""symptoms"":

I know this probably isn't nothing compared what other people go through. I even thought this didn't affect me, I thought most people go through either the same or worse, until I was about 20 years old.

But once every day, or every 2-3 days, I get intense, intrusive memories about these events. I feel extreme anger and hate, my heart rate goes sky high, sometimes even my hands start shaking. I feel like I can't stop thinking about it, sometimes for an hour or two.

This usually happens when I'm trying to study or sometimes it even happens while I'm listening to a lecture at my university. Sometimes at the university I just zone out and kind of relive these events, going though them in my head. Other than that, when I'm not going through this, I have a tough time concentrating. I think ""episodes"" happens when I get bored or when my mind isn't stimulated. Like, I don't think they happen if I distract myself with the Internet or doing some hobby that I like.

 I remember feeling like this at least once a week ever since I was around 15 or so.

  I used to have nightmares about either fighting for life with my brother or my dad or someone else, or about seizures happening to me or people around me every day. Now I have them maybe once a week or two.

I get something that feels like an adrenaline rush when I'm bringing this up, for instance as I'm writing this, or when my brother decides to visit my mom, and sometimes it just happens randomly.

Does this sound like PTSD or at least a reason to visit a mental health professional? I honestly thought PTSD accompanied a lot more brutal traumatic experiences, like what you'd hear in war stories.

Also, I think I've had social anxiety for the better part of my life, but I think that's getting better now.

Does ""reliving a traumatic experience"" necessarily mean you feel all the sensations you felt back then? Or is it enough to emotionally experience it again?

How do I know if this is PTSD or just some normal reaction?

Edit: I just realized the backstory and the traumatic events might not have been necessary, sorry about that.";0

804;804;2633_ptsd;"Working through PTSD in therapy [tw: abuse + sexual assault] I've been seeing my therapist for a couple years and the main reason was to help with PTSD. I ended up cowarding out numerous times but now we're actually getting into it and attempting to work through it. Logically, I know that my abuser (ex gf) will not come back and I will never see her again and know that what happened, unfortunately happened, but it is not happening /now/. Even though I know this, it doesn't help.

I cannot physically speak about it. No matter how long I sit there going through the events in my head -- I can never speak about it. Writing is fine. But I cannot speak like something is holding my mouth shut. This is causing some issues with getting things out there for therapy...

[Some background: I was raped numerous times, have gotten blackout drunk to the point I couldn't move and just lay there to try and be okay with the sexual advances, guilted, emotionally and mentally abused, manipulated, was made into the abuser somehow, etc.
This happened right after high school with an older woman (I am FTM) around 4 to 5 years ago now. I still have nightmares about being raped again or her coming back. I cannot go to some places without a panic attack happening or being extremely uncomfortable. I cannot say her name.]

When bringing it up or talking about it, I disassociate intensely and just forget what I say, forget what happened, and don't remember what happened in therapy once I come back.
I've planned on writing about events that I can remember and giving them to my therapist to read.

But is there a way or does anyone have experience or advice in keeping yourself grounded through it? Disassociating throughout my session is not helping but I can't find a way to stay.";1

788;788;2657_ptsd;"Would you expose your childhood abuser? Recently I have come to terms with my flashbacks and repressed memories being real. It was a close family member. I was about 5 and he must have been around 9-10. The only thing I remember clearly is him holding me down in a bed and taking my trousers off, everything else is very blurry. Throughout the life he would also act very disturbing, but at this point I was old enough to tell him to stop being inappropriate. He was doing this like rubbing my thigh or trying to caress my breast. I don't know why I didn't connect the dots, my brain just wouldn't let me tbh. 
I have broken down badly now and I am using medication atm. But the worst thing ever for me is just a few months ago his second daughter was born. And I feel so scared. I don't want those baby girls to go through anything like that, I wish i could somehow warn his wife or another family member. I obvs have 0 proof and well I come from a post communist country, where you never ever talk about anything like this and your mental health is a no no.

695;695;2000_ptsd;"Wow. The Nightmares. Oh. My. Gosh. Forgot all about the PTSD nightmares. I'd fought them for years, and hadn't had them nearly as often lately -- or when I did, I  wasn't remembering them anymore, thank goodness. I recently got a secondary PTSD diagnosis related to medical surgeries/bone setting, and it has really kicked up my PTSD symptoms. Flinching from loud noises, contact, nightmares, anxiety, constant fear. 

With the new secondary  medical PTSD diagnosis -- the nightmares have come back, are violent, and are atrocious. Was up and down all night, and finally slept around 6AM.  And then I finally slept, and WOW. The nightmares. 

Was with a group of really shady people, and we were on some kind of late night mission. It all felt natural though, because I used to socialize with  some pretty shady people... -sighs- Don't ask. Just trying to get this out of my head so that I can shake reliving them in my head. Basically trekked with them to this unknown house, late at night, and everything went super south, super fast. 

The people I was with -- they murdered a woman that used to be my friend. I mean, I got held back, tied up, and told I needed to watch this. It was like being apart of the Manson/Tate murders, without being included. And I like... watched her, her husband, and her three children, get murdered by these shady people. I didn't... *do* anything. I *couldn't*... do anything. I felt the helplessness. The inability to do anything. I hate my brain. 

I think it was guilt. We had a  falling out a few years back over drug use. She got sick, and needed a heart transplant, and died less than a year after the transplant. She passed away a couple years ago, after a heart transplant failed to take.  She only had two kids. It felt so real. Like I hadn't seen her in so long, and in that time, she'd had another kid...

Three kids. Her  and her husband. Still hearing the damned screams. I don't remember it all -- but I definitely remember the screams. The blood. Stabbing. I started to realize it was a dream, and I was screaming. ""WAKE UP! WAKE  UP, IT'S NOT REAL. SHE DIED. I KNOW SHE DIED, WAKE UP."" I swore I was screaming in my sleep like I used to. I woke up abruptly, rolled out of bed, and just stared at the wall, breathing hard. It was bad. I forgot all about just how bad the night terrors are. They've been bad the past few weeks -- but this one... just... I can't shake it, and I'm still tearing up. Brutal.";0
431;431;284_ptsd;"You are NOT alone! Hi Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Bastiaan and 20 years old. I am a Dutch boy and I am suffering from PTSD for 12 years now. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the age of 8, I have seen a man who tried to take his life by using (meat) hooks. To make things worse, around the age of 13 I have seen a deadly car accident. To top it all of: at the age of 17 I conquered another suicide attempt. This time a roommate who tried to take her life using a knife. 

I got diagnosed with PTSD at the age of 16. This is also were I started EMDR. It helped me a lot and I am almost symptom-free. Because I have quite much experience, I would like to help others. This, and I want to try to talk about the things I have experienced, because I have always been silent about my past.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is anybody who needs someone to talk to, or has some questions, or something else: please message me. I am a warm person and I am always ready to help someone who is suffering from the same thing I do.

&amp;#x200B;

With love,

1062;1062;2414_ptsd;"You get diagnosed, but what’s next? I got diagnosed back in December of 2018. They didn’t tell me when they diagnosed me. They waited until I was checking out to leave the hospital, and as I signed my last paper, the nurse said, “your doctor has diagnosed you with PTSD. Sign here to confirm that I’ve told you this.” 

Who does that? Who gives such a blow and expects you to recover well enough to drive yourself home? I didn’t let it hit me until I got home. I sat at the end of my bed and just thought. I thought about everything that led to this. I kept telling myself that I caused this because I wasn’t strong enough to not let things get to me. 

I’m still thinking that. I’m still thinking,  actually. It still hurts to think about my diagnoses and to remember everything that led up to it. I’ve been diagnosed, but now what? Do I just spend my time thinking? Or am I supposed to do something?";0
